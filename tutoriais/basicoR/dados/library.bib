abstract = {This paper models firms' choices between alternative means of presenting information, and the effects of different presentations on market prices when investors have limited attention and processing power. In a market equilibrium with partially attentive investors, we examine the effects of alternative: levels of discretion in pro forma earnings disclosure, methods of accounting for employee option compensation, and degrees of aggregation in reporting. We derive empirical implications relating pro forma adjustments, option compensation, the growth, persistence, and informativeness of earnings, short-run managerial incentives, and other firm characteristics to stock price reactions, misvaluation, long-run abnormal returns, and corporate decisions.},

abstract = {Este estudo analisou se o {\'{i}}ndice market-to-book utilizado no mercado de capitais como medida que captura as oportunidades de crescimento das firmas e a expectativa de fluxo de caixa futuro pode ser utilizado como incentivo para que executivos gerenciem os resultados para manter a expectativa dos diversos agentes do mercado. A amostra possui um total de 931 observa{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es para o per{\'{i}}odo de 1998 at{\'{e}} 2005. Os accruals discricion{\'{a}}rios (proxy para gerenciamento de resultados) foram obtidos por uma regress{\~{a}}o robusta utilizando o modelo desenvolvido por Kang e Sivaramakrishnan (1995). Inicialmente foram formados dois grandes grupos de firmas, sendo 552 observa{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es para firmas com market-to-book menor que 1 e 379 com {\'{i}}ndice maior que 1, que foram testados com uma regress{\~{a}}o com vari{\'{a}}vel bin{\'{a}}ria (dummy) e teste de diferen{\c{c}}a de m{\'{e}}dia entre os dois grupos. Adicionalmente, realizou-se uma terceira regress{\~{a}}o com vari{\'{a}}veis bin{\'{a}}rias agrupando as firmas com market-to-book entre 0 e 1, maior que 1 e menor que 0 para corroborar os resultados. As evid{\^{e}}ncias dos testes estat{\'{i}}sticos indicam que as firmas com market-to-book entre 0 e 1 e, principalmente, acima de 1 possuem rela{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o positiva e maior grau no teste de m{\'{e}}dia com os accruals discricion{\'{a}}rios do que os demais grupos de firmas. Dessa forma, as firmas com esta medida maior que 1 possuem incentivos do mercado para gerenciar os resultados e manter o valor de mercado descolado do valor cont{\'{a}}bil (book-value) complementarmente {\`{a}}s atividades das companhias para gerar fluxo de caixa futuro.},

abstract = {This article addresses the following basic capital budgeting problem: suppose that cross sectional differences in stock returns can be predicted based on variables other than P(e.g., book-to-market) and that this predictability reflects market irrationality rather than compensation for fundamental risk. In this setting, how should companies determine hurdle rates? I show how factors such as managerial time horizons and financial constraints affect the optimal hurdle rate. Under some circumstances, p can be useful as a capital budgeting tool, even if it is of no use in predicting stock returns.},

abstract = {We design an intuitive yet simple measure of market liquidity (TC) to capture “flight to liquidity” aspect of the liquidity risk. TC is constructed as the ratio of total trade volume of stocks in the top trading volume quintile to that in the bottom. Its variation captures the liquidity shift between the most liquid (highest quality) and the least liquid (lowest quality) stocks, intensified during the flight to liquidity. Among the liquidity risk factors, one constructed from TC (TC factor) is the most effective in yielding evidence consistent with the predictions of popular models of flight to liquidity. TC is a priced state variable whose pricing impact is beyond those of existing liquidity measures. Annualized return spread between top and bottom quintiles of TC factor loading sorted portfolios is about 5{\%}.},

@article{Michelson1995,
abstract = {Over the last three decades income smoothing has been analyzed in various ways. Several studies have focused on three issues: (a) do firms actually smooth income; (b) the smoothing ability of various accounting techniques; and (c) conditions under which smoothing is effective (Lev and Kunitzky, 1974, p. 268). Smoothing studies have also focused on (a) objectives of smoothing (management motivation), (b) objects of smoothing (operating income, net income), (c) dimensions of smoothing (real or artificial), and (d) smoothing variables (i.e., extraordinary items, tax credits) (Ronen and Sadan, 1981, p. 6). However, little attention has been given to the reaction in the marketplace to income smoothing. Yet for forty years, many assumptions and conclusions pertaining to relationships between smoothing and the marketplace have been set forth. Hepworth (1953) advanced the idea that stable earnings give owners and creditors a more confident feeling toward management. Gordon (1964, p. 262) proposed that stockholder satisfaction increases with the rate of growth in a company's income and the stability of its income. Beidleman (1973, p. 655) suggested that as analysts become more enthusiastic about self smoothers, smoothing may indirectly widen the market for a firm's shares and there should be a favorable effect on share value and cost of capital. Lev and Kunitzky (1974, p. 268) stated that their results indicate that income variability is significantly correlated with both overall and systematic risk measures. Moses (1987, p. 366) stated that smoothing implies a direct, cause-and-effect relationship between earnings fluctuations and market risk.},

Issuance predicts poor future returns and is preceded by high returns, but only when the controlling shareholder's stake is significantly reduced.

To resolve this problem, CUC adopted an accounting change and then underwent a leveraged recapitalization. Subsequently, it accelerated recap debt repayments and initiated a stock repurchase. CUC's experience suggests that accounting reports are not always effective in investor communication. While financial signals are more effective, their impact is not as immediate as predicted by prior research.

@article{Bessiere2014,
abstract = {Purpose – This article aims to examine the link between uncertainty and analysts' reaction to earnings announcements for a sample of European firms during the period 1997-2007. In the same way as Daniel et al., the authors posit that overconfidence leads to an overreaction to private information followed by an underreaction when the information becomes public. Design/methodology/approach – In this study, the authors test analysts' overconfidence through the overreaction preceding a public announcement followed by an underreaction after the announcement. If overconfidence occurs, over- and underreactions should be, respectively, observed before and after the public announcement. If uncertainty boosts overconfidence, the authors predict that these two combined misreactions should be stronger when uncertainty is higher. Uncertainty is defined according to technology intensity, and separate two types of firms: high-tech or low-tech. The authors use a sample of European firms during the period 1997-2007. Findings – The results support the overconfidence hypothesis. The authors jointly observe the two phenomena of under- and overreaction. Overreaction occurs when the information has not yet been made public and disappears just after public release. The results also show that both effects are more important for the high-tech subsample. For robustness, the authors sort the sample using analyst forecast dispersion as a proxy for uncertainty and obtain similar results. The authors also document that the high-tech stocks crash in 2000-2001 moderated the overconfidence of analysts, which then strongly declined during the post-crash period. Originality/value – This study offers interesting insights in two ways. First, in the area of financial markets, it provides a test of a major over- and underreaction model and implements it to analysts' reactions through their revisions (versus investors' reactions through stock returns). Second, in a broader way, itdealswiththe linkbetweenuncertaintyandbiases.The results are consistentwiththe experimental evidence and extend it to a cross-sectional analysis that reinforces it as pointed out by Kumar.},

abstract = {Using transaction data on the S{\&}P 100 index options, we study the effect of valuation simplifications that are commonplace in previous research on the time- series properties of implied market volatility. Using an American-style algorithm that accounts for the discrete nature of the dividends on the S{\&}P 100 index, we find that spurious negative serial correlation in implied volatility changes is induced by nonsimultaneously observing the option price and the index level. Negative serial correlation is also induced by a bid/ask price effect if a single option is used to estimate implied volatility. In addition, we find that these same effects induce spurious (and unreasonable) negative cross-correlations between the changes in call and put implied volatility.},

@article{Fama1970,
abstract = {THE PRIMARY ROLE of the capital market is allocation of ownership of the economy's capital stock. In general terms, the ideal is a market in which prices provide accurate signals for resource allocation: that is, a market in which firms can make production-investment decisions, and investors can choose among the securities that represent ownership of firms' activities under the assumption that security prices at any time "fully reflect" all available in- formation. A market in which prices always "fully reflect" available informa- tion is called "efficient." This paper reviews the theoretical and empirical literature on the efficient markets model. After a discussion of the theory, empirical work concerned with the adjustment of security prices to three relevant information subsets is considered. First, weak form tests, in which the information set is just historical prices, are discussed. Then semi-strong form tests, in which the con- cern is whether prices efficiently adjust to other information that is obviously publicly available (e.g., announcements of annual earnings, stock splits, etc,) are considered. Finally, strong form tests concerned with whether given in- vestors or groups have monopolistic access to any information relevant for price formation are reviewed.l We shall conclude that, with but a few ex- ceptions, the efficient markets model stands up well. Though we proceed from theory to empirical work, to keep the proper historical perspective we should note to a large extent the empirical work in this area preceded the development of the theory. The theory is presented first here in order to more easily judge which of the empirical results are most relevant from the viewpoint of the theory. The empirical work itself, however, will then be reviewed in more or less historical sequence. Finally, the perceptive reader will surely recognize instances in this paper where relevant studies are not specifically discussed. In such cases my apol- ogies should be taken for granted. The area is so bountiful that some such injustices are unavoidable. But the primary goal here will have been ac- complished if a coherent picture of the main lines of the work on efficient markets is presented, along with an accurate picture of the current state of the arts.},

abstract = {Purpose: Under the assumption that managers have incentives to practice earnings management in optimistic moments, this paper aims to analyze whether analysts' monitoring affects the relation between the discretionary accumulations (accruals) and investor sentiment in the Brazilian capital market. Originality/value: The mediating role of analysts in the relation between investor sentiment and earnings management was not identified in the literature establishing an important gap to be investigated, given the relevance of the reported earnings for the decision-making process of market participants. Design/methodology/approach: Fixed effects regressions (industry and quarter) were estimated from 2010 to 2016, using all data and the subsetting sample according to whether or not companies were monitored by analysts. Findings: The results showed a reduction of earnings management after optimistic moments, which differs from the initial expectation and such behavior is attributed to the presence of analysts following companies. The results were robust to alternative proxies for earnings management and investor sentiment. Analysts have an influence on accounting earnings supporting the best disclosure, so inhibiting the practice of earnings management in optimistic moments. Therefore, although previous studies suggest that earnings management practices increase during optimistic moments, market participants may consider, even in such moments, a better earnings quality when firms are monitored by analysts.},

abstract = {THIS PAPER'S TITLE IS INTENDED to remind you of Fischer Black's well-known note on “The Dividend Puzzle,” which he closed by saying, “What should the corporation do about dividend policy? We don't know.” [6, p. 81 I will start by asking, “How do firms choose their capital structures?” Again, the answer is, “We don't know.” The capital structure puzzle is tougher than the dividend one. We know quite a bit about dividend policy. John Lintner's model of how firms set dividends [20] dates back to 1956, and it still seems to work. We know stock prices respond to unanticipated dividend changes, so it is clear that dividends have information content-this observation dates back at least to Miller and Modigliani (MM) in 1961 [28]. We do not know whether high dividend yield increases the expected rate of return demanded by investors, as adding taxes to the MM proof of dividend irrelevance suggests, but financial economists are at least hammering away at this issue. By contrast, we know very little about capital structure. We do not know how firms choose the debt, equity or hybrid securities they issue. We have only recently discovered that capital structure changes convey information to inves- tors. There has been little if any research testing whether the relationship between financial leverage and investors' required return is as the pure MM theory predicts. In general, we have inadequate understanding of corporate financing behavior, and of how that behavior affects security returns. I do not want to sound too pessimistic or discouraged. We have accumulated many helpful insights into capital structure choice, starting with the most important one, MM's No Magic in Leverage Theorem (Proposition I) 1313. We have thought long and hard about what these insights imply for optimal capital structure. Many of us have translated these theories, or stories, of optimal capital structure into more or less definite advice to managers. But our theories don't seem to explain actual financing behavior, and it seems presumptuous to advise firms on optimal capital structure when we are so far from explaining actual decisions. I have done more than my share of writing on optimal capital structure, so I take this opportunity to make amends, and to try to push research in some new directions.},

abstract = {This paper examines the relationship of analysts' coverage, forecasting errors and earnings management. It corroborates the role of analysts as gatekeepers by finding that analysts enhance transparency and reduce the scope of earnings management. To identify analysts' coverage we used the I/B/E/S, from where we also obtained information on the consensus projections of analysts for listed Brazilian companies. The results indicated a negative correlation between the number of analysts covering firms and the magnitude of their discretionary accruals in absolute terms, indicating that more scrutiny inhibits earnings management. We also found a negative correlation between analysts' coverage and forecasting errors. Multivariate regressions showed statistically significant results in the same sense. Therefore, market analysts, despite the severe criticism they receive from the specialized press, actually have a beneficial effect on corporate governance by monitoring managers and inhibiting earnings management.

O estudo {\'{e}} uma adapta{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do artigo de Gaud et al. (2005), cujo trabalho serviu como base e principal refer{\^{e}}ncia para a escolha das principais vari{\'{a}}veis e dos testes econom{\'{e}}tricos realizados. Tal como Gaud et al. (2005), desenvolvemos as an{\'{a}}lises estat{\'{i}}sticas utilizando a metodologia de Panel Data, que considera os dados da amostra em corte transversal e longitudinal. Al{\'{e}}m de testes est{\'{a}}ticos, foram feitos testes din{\^{a}}micos, com o objetivo de analisar o processo de ajuste da estrutura de capital ao longo do tempo, em dire{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o a um suposto n{\'{i}}vel-alvo {\'{o}}timo. Os resultados demonstraram rela{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o negativa entre o n{\'{i}}vel de endividamento das empresas e o grau de tangibilidade dos ativos e a rentabilidade, bem como rela{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o positiva do endividamento com o risco. Demonstraram ainda que empresas de capital estrangeiro s{\~{a}}o mais endividadas que empresas nacionais. De um modo geral, os resultados sugerem que a teoria de Pecking Order {\'{e}} mais consistente do que a teoria de trade-off para explicar a estrutura de capital das companhias abertas brasileiras. Em especial, destacamos a rela{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o negativa entre endividamento e rentabilidade, confirmando v{\'{a}}rios outros resultados de pesquisa obtidos na realidade brasileira. A an{\'{a}}lise din{\^{a}}mica demonstrou baixa velocidade do processo de ajuste da estrutura de capital em dire{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o ao n{\'{i}}vel-alvo, sugerindo a exist{\^{e}}ncia de elevados custos de transa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o e confirmando o comportamento de Pecking Order dos administradores.},

abstract = {Este trabalho teve como objetivo verificar se existe rela{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o entre o sentimento do investidor e as anomalias de mercado no Brasil. Adicionalmente, tamb{\'{e}}m foi analisado se os desvios de pre{\c{c}}os provocados por investidores com vi{\'{e}}s otimista s{\~{a}}o diferentes daqueles provocados pelos investidores pessimistas. A popula{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o envolveu todas as empresas listadas na BM{\&}FBOVESPA. Os dados utilizados foram coletados no Economatica{\textregistered}. Para c{\'{a}}lculo dos retornos, foram utilizados pre{\c{c}}os de fechamento mensais no per{\'{i}}odo de junho de 2000 a junho de 2014, bem como dados cont{\'{a}}beis anuais de 1999 a 2013. Para mensura{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do {\'{i}}ndice de sentimento agregado para o mercado, foram consideradas todas as emiss{\~{o}}es de a{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es ocorridas no per{\'{i}}odo de janeiro de 1999 a junho de 2014, bem como o volume de negocia{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es e de t{\'{i}}tulos dispon{\'{i}}veis nesse per{\'{i}}odo. Na estima{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do sentimento do investidor, fez-se uso da t{\'{e}}cnica multivariada de An{\'{a}}lise de Componentes Principais, para captar o componente em comum de quatro diferentes proxies para o comportamento do mercado. Para verificar a forma como sentimento do investidor se relaciona com as anomalias, foram testadas empiricamente com a s{\'{e}}rie dos retornos das carteiras de posi{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o Long, Short e Long-Short de 12 estrat{\'{e}}gias baseadas em anomalias; e com a s{\'{e}}rie do {\'{i}}ndice de sentimento constru{\'{i}}do e sua varia{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de um m{\^{e}}s para o outro. Constatou-se que a medida do {\'{i}}ndice de sentimento apresentou poder explicativo para boa parte das anomalias apenas quando inclu{\'{i}}da no CAPM, por{\'{e}}m ao controlar pelo modelo de tr{\^{e}}s fatores e de quatro fatores, o coeficiente perdeu sua signific{\^{a}}ncia estat{\'{i}}stica. J{\'{a}} na utiliza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o da varia{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do {\'{i}}ndice como vari{\'{a}}vel explicativa, observou-se uma rela{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o com os retornos futuros, robustos a todos os fatores de risco. Dessa forma, {\'{e}} poss{\'{i}}vel relacionar o {\'{i}}ndice de sentimento do investidor com os retornos de carteiras formadas com base em anomalias de valor. Na an{\'{a}}lise dos retornos m{\'{e}}dios ap{\'{o}}s os per{\'{i}}odos de otimismo e pessimismo, n{\~{a}}o houve valores estatisticamente significantes suficientes para inferir sobre uma poss{\'{i}}vel exist{\^{e}}ncia de restri{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es {\`{a}}s opera{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es de venda a descoberto, apesar de boa parte das anomalias apresentarem o sinal esperado no spread entre a m{\'{e}}dia dos retornos ap{\'{o}}s per{\'{i}}odos otimistas e pessimistas.},

Variables that are derived from the yield curve that are already known to predict returns on bonds also predict returns on bond-like stocks; investor sentiment, a predictor of the cross-section of stock returns, also predicts excess bond returns. These relationships remain in place even when bonds and stocks become "decoupled" at the index level. They are driven by a combination of effects including correlations between real cash flows on bonds and bond-like stocks, correlations between their risk-based return premia, and periodic flights to quality.},

Our formulation clarifies the relationship between the existing estimators and the role of transformations in panel data models.

We present an alternative transformation for models with predetermined instruments which preserves the orthogonality among the errors. Finally, we consider models with predetermined variables that have constant correlation with the effects and illustrate their importance with simulations.},

Moreover, the relationships involving risk are mediated by Baker–Wurgler sentiment, with directional effects similar to those that have already been docu- mented for realised returns. In this regard, Baker-Wurgler sentiment mediates the time series of investors' judgments of expected return and the cross-section of their judgments about risk. The results are consistent with the position that investors' judgments of risk and return, both mediated by sentiment, influence market prices.},

Prior literature establishes a positive link between growing institutional ownership and idiosyncratic volatility. However, this effect may vary depending on the type of institutional ownership. We document that short‐term (long‐term) institutional ownership is positively (negatively) linked to idiosyncratic volatility in the cross section. These opposite effects persist after controlling for institutional preferences and information‐based trading and remain qualitatively unchanged after controlling for endogeneity. This suggests that short‐term (long‐term) institutions exhibit higher (lower) trading activity, which increases (decreases) idiosyncratic volatility.},

Minha experi{\^{e}}ncia tem sido a de que as estruturas atuais tendem mais a obscurecer do que a esclare-cer seu significado. Al{\'{e}}m disso, os trabalhos de Kaplan, Dubin e outros sobre o assunto variam amplamente na academia. Este artigo {\'{e}} um esfor{\c{c}}o rudimentar para preencher tal la-cuna: o objetivo n{\~{a}}o {\'{e}} criar uma nova conceitualiza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o te{\'{o}}ri-ca, mas sim propor uma s{\'{e}}rie de simples conceitos para dis-cuss{\~{a}}o do processo de desenvolvimento de teoria.

Minha motiva{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o {\'{e}} facilitar os problemas de comunica{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o referentes a expectativas e padr{\~{o}}es, que resul-tam da aus{\^{e}}ncia de uma estrutura amplamente aceita para discuss{\~{a}}o da qualidade da produ{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o conceitual nas ci{\^{e}}ncias organizacionais. Por fim, meus coment{\'{a}}rios n{\~{a}}o devem ser interpretados como um dogma oficial da AMR nem como regras r{\'{i}}gidas que governam o processo de avalia{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o. Cada artigo subme-tido {\'{e}} {\'{u}}nico e {\'{e}} julgado por suas pr{\'{o}}prias qualidades. No entanto, meu pensamento foi claramente influenciado pelas centenas de comunica{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es que li na primeira metade de meus anos como editor. Este artigo est{\'{a}} organizado em torno de tr{\^{e}}s quest{\~{o}}es-cha-ves: a) Quais s{\~{a}}o os blocos de constru{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o para o desenvolvi-mento de teoria?; b) O que {\'{e}} uma contribui{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o leg{\'{i}}tima e que agrega valor ao desenvolvimento de teoria?; e c) Quais os fato-res considerados na avalia{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de artigos conceituais? A primei-ra se{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o descreve os elementos que constituem uma teoria. A segunda utiliza essa estrutura para estabelecer padr{\~{o}}es para o processo de desenvolvimento de uma teoria. E a terceira se{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o resume as expectativas dos avaliadores com rela{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o {\`{a}}s contri-bui{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es substanciais e {\`{a}} adequa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o dos artigos da AMR. De acordo com autoridades no desenvolvimento de teori-as (por exemplo, Dubin, 1978), uma teoria completa deve possuir quatro elementos essenciais, que s{\~{a}}o descritos nos par{\'{a}}grafos abaixo. O qu{\^{e}} Quais fatores – vari{\'{a}}veis, construtos, conceitos – logica-mente devem ser considerados como parte da explica{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do fen{\^{o}}meno social ou individual em quest{\~{a}}o?

abstract = {We use the returns on lottery-like stocks and a dynamic factor model to construct a novel index of investor sentiment. This new measure is highly correlated with other behavioral indicators, but more closely tracks speculative episodes. Our main new finding is that the effects of sentiment are asymmetric: During peak-to-trough periods of investor sentiment (sentiment contractions), high sentiment predicts low future returns for the cross section of speculative stocks and for the market overall, whereas the relationship between sentiment and future returns is positive but relatively weak during trough-to-peak episodes (sentiment expansions). Overall, these results match theories and anecdotal accounts of investor sentiment.},

@article{Sharpe1964,
abstract = {ONE OF THE PROBLEMS which has plagued those attempting to predict the behavior of capital markets is the absence of a body of positive micro- economic theory dealing with conditions of risk. Although many useful insights can be obtained from the traditional models of investment under conditions of certainty, the pervasive influence of risk in financial trans- actions has forced those working in this area to adopt models of price behavior which are little more than assertions. A typical classroom ex- planation of the determination of capital asset prices, for example, usually begins with a careful and relatively rigorous description of the process through which individual preferences and physical relationships interact to determine an equilibrium pure interest rate. This is generally followed by the assertion that somehow a market risk-premium is also determined, with the prices of assets adjusting accordingly to account for differences in their risk.},

abstract = {This paper is one of the first to investigate the determinants of bond issuance by European banks. We use a unique database of around 50,000 bonds issued by 63 banks from 14 European countries, allowing us to differentiate between different types of long-term debt securities. By investigating at the individual bank level, we are able to test explicitly a broad set of hypotheses from both the corporate finance and banking literature on the drivers of bond issuance. We use both country and bank-specific financial characteristics as explanatory variables. With respect to the country determinants, our findings suggest that “market timing” (low interest rates) drove issuance before but not during the crisis, when access to funding became more important than its cost. Moreover, during the crisis years, country-risk characteristics became drivers of bond issuance, while for banks from the euro area periphery central bank liquidity substituted for unsecured long-term debt. We also show that heightened financial market tensions were detrimental to bond issuance, and more strongly so during crisis episodes. Our results yield strongly significant coefficients for the bank-specific variables, with signs as expected. We find evidence of “leverage targeting” by issuing long-term debt during the crisis years. The positive and significant coefficient for the capital ratio supports the “risk absorption” hypothesis, suggesting that larger capital buffers enhanced the risk-bearing capacity of banks and allowed them to issue more debt. Moreover, banks with deposit supply constraints and relatively large loan portfolios issued more bonds, both before and since the crisis years. We also find that higher rated banks were more likely to issue bonds, also during the crisis period. Stronger banks issued especially unsecured debt, while weaker banks resorted more to issuance of covered bonds. Overall, our results suggest that stronger banks – including those from peripheral countries – maintained better access to longer-term funding markets, even during crisis periods. Our results pass several robustness tests. We present an additional aggregated country analysis in a separate appendix.},

abstract = {This article studies the effect of investor sentiment on stock returns in three Central European markets: the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland. The results show that sentiment is a key variable in the prices of stocks traded on these markets, and has a stronger impact here than in more developed European markets. This effect is linked to stock characteristics, particularly those considered to make stocks more prone to the influence of investor sentiment. The evidence shows that the effect is not uniform across countries, since higher levels are found for Poland and the Czech Republic, thus confirming the role of country-specific factors in the impact of investor sentiment on stock prices. The results also confirm that sentiment is a twofold (global and local) phenomenon, in which the global dimension has much greater impact than the local dimension, at least in the markets considered. Finally, the article shows that sentiment does not spread, at least to any significant degree, through the movement of capital between markets. This strengthens the argument that sentiment is transmitted through a behavioral mechanism. If this argument proves correct, there is little likelihood of local regulatory action being very effective in limiting the perverse impact of asset bubbles.},

This effect is observed primarily for small stocks because these stocks are more likely to be followed by individual investors, who tend to have limited attention.

The weight matrix used in the calculation of the e!cient two-step GMM estimator is based on initial consistent parameter estimates. In this paper it is shown that the extra variation due to the presence of these estimated parameters in the weight matrix accounts for much of the diference between the finite sample and the usual asymptotic variance of the two-step GMM estimator, when the moment conditions used are linear in the parameters. This diference can be estimated, resulting in a finite sample corrected estimate of the variance. In a Monte Carlo study of a panel data model it is shown that the corrected variance estimate approximates the finite sample variance well, leading to more accurate inference.},

abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to focus on valuation practices applied by analysts to derive target price forecasts in Asian emerging markets. The key objective of this study is to understand valuation model preference of analysts and to compare the predictive utility of target price forecasts derived through heuristics- driven price-to-earnings (PE) model and theoretically sound discounted cash flow (DCF) model. Design/methodology/approach – Each research report in the sample of 502 research reports has been studied in detail to understand the dominant valuation model (PE or DCF) applied by analyst to derive target price forecasts. These research reports have been issued on stocks trading in seven emerging markets including India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Taiwan, Philippines, Korea and Thailand during a six-year period starting 2008. Standard OLS and logit regression analysis has been performed to derive empirical findings. Findings – The study finds that lower regulatory and reporting standards prevailing in emerging markets have no significant bearing on analyst choice of valuation model (PE or DCF). Time-series analysis suggests that emerging market analysts did not rely upon the usage of DCF model and preferred PE model during and immediately after the financial crisis of 2008. Multivariate regression results show weak evidence that PE model produces better results than DCF model after adjusting for the complexities associated with analyzing emerging market equities. The results imply that PE model, to some degree, is better equipped to capture market moods and sentiment in dynamic emerging markets rather than theoretically sound DCF model. Originality/value – Most past studies on valuation model practices have focused on developed markets and this study provides a fresh perspective on analyst valuation model practices and performance in a new institutional setting of Asian emerging markets. The marginally better predictive utility of PE model as compared to DCF model is possibly a feature limited to Asian emerging markets.},

The equilibrium price's rational term drives the asset price to the rational, and the sentiment term leads to the asset price deviating from it. In our model, the proportion of sentiment investors and the information quality could amplify the sentiment shock on the asset price. Finally, the information is fully incorporated into prices when sentiment investors learn from prices. The model could offer a partial explanation of some financial anomalies: price bubbles, high volatility, asset prices' momentum effect and reversal effect.},

Listed firms invest substantially less and are less responsive to changes in investment opportunities compared to matched private firms, even during the recent financial crisis. These differences do not reflect observable economic differences between public and private firms (such as lifecycle differences) and instead appear to be driven by a propensity for public firms to suffer greater agency costs. Evidence showing that investment behavior diverges most strongly in industries in which stock prices are particularly sensitive to current earnings suggests public firms may suffer from managerial myopia.},

abstract = {We present a simple overlapping generations model of an asset mar- ket in which irrational noise traders with erroneous stochastic beliefs both affect prices and earn higher expected returns. The unpredict- ability of noise traders' beliefs creates a risk in the price of the asset that deters rational arbitrageurs from aggressively betting against them. As a result, prices can diverge significantly from fundamental values even in the absence of fundamental risk. Moreover, bearing a disproportionate amount of risk that they themselves create enables noise traders to earn a higher expected return than rational inves- tors do. The model sheds light on a number of financial anomalies, including the excess volatility of asset prices, the mean reversion of stock returns, the underpricing of closed-end mutual funds, and the Mehra-Prescott equity premium puzzle.},

I predict that bullish market-wide sentiment induces investors to aggressively separate firms with high growth futures from others, and that this excessive boldness results in a high level of mispricing. Consistent with my prediction, I observe an excessively large dispersion in consensus growth forecasts when proxies for investor sentiment are high at the beginning of the period. Furthermore, stocks with higher-predicted growth experience more negative forecast revisions and lower subsequent stock returns, especially following periods of high investor sentiment.},

Dealscan offers several advantages over the data available in previous studies, principally larger and more representative samples and the availability of extensive actual covenant detail. These advantages allow us to construct powerful tests in which we find clear support for the debt covenant hypothesis. We also use these data to provide broad evidence on the economic role of debt covenants. We find that private lenders set debt covenants tightly and use them as "trip wires" for borrowers, that technical violations occur relatively often, and that violations are not necessarily associated with financial distress. Finally, since we measure covenant slack directly, we report evidence that the extensively-used leverage variable is a relatively noisy proxy for closeness to covenants.},

Aggregate leverage-low and stable before 1945-more than tripled between 1945 and 1970 from 11{\%} to 35{\%}, eventually reaching 47{\%} by the early 1990s. The median firm in 1946 had no debt, but by 1970 had a leverage ratio of 31{\%}. This increase occurred in all unregulated industries and affected firms of all sizes. Changing firm characteristics are unable to account for this increase. Rather, changes in government borrowing, macroeconomic uncertainty, and financial sector development play a more prominent role. Despite this increase among unregulated firms, a combination of stable debt usage among regulated firms and a decrease in the fraction of aggregate assets held by regulated firms over this period resulted in a relatively stable economy-wide leverage ratio during the 20th century.},

While prior research finds that liquidity has mixed effects on corporate governance, our baseline regression results show that an increase in stock liquidity is associated with an increase in discretionary accruals and revenues. To establish causality, we use two quasi-natural experiments that exploit exogenous increases in stock liquidity resulting from regulatory changes to the minimum tick size. The results of our difference-in-differences approach indicate that stock liquidity increases accrual-based earnings management. Additional analysis suggests that liquidity affects earningsmanagement bymagnifying the effects of takeover pressure and equity compensation.},

abstract = {Dispersion in investor beliefs and short-selling constraints can lead to stock market bubbles. This paper argues that firms, unlike investors, can exploit such bubbles by issuing new shares at inflated prices. This lowers the cost of capital and increases real investment. Perhaps surprisingly, large bubbles are not eliminated in equilibrium nor do large bubbles necessarily imply large distortions. Using the variance of analysts' earnings forecasts to proxy for the dispersion of investor beliefs, we find that increases in dispersion cause increases in new equity issuance, Tobin's Q, and real investment, as predicted by the model. {\textcopyright} 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Does foundation ownership lead to long{\&}{\#}8208;term corporate governance and business behavior in foundation{\&}{\#}8208;owned companies?. Research Findings/Insights. Short{\&}{\#}8208;termism has become a serious concern for corporate governance, and this has inspired a search for institutional arrangements to promote long{\&}{\#}8208;term decision{\&}{\#}8208;making. In this paper, we call attention to long{\&}{\#}8208;term ownership by industrial foundations, which is common in Northern Europe but little known in the rest of the world. We use a unique Danish data set to document that industrial foundations are long{\&}{\#}8208;term owners that practice long{\&}{\#}8208;term governance. We show that foundation ownership is highly stable compared to other ownership structures. Foundation{\&}{\#}8208;owned companies replace managers less frequently. They have conservative capital structures with low financial leverage. They score higher on an index of long{\&}{\#}8208;termism in finance, investment, and employment. They survive longer. Overall, our paper supports the hypothesis that corporate time horizons are influenced by ownership structures, and particularly that industrial foundations possess characteristics that promote long{\&}{\#}8208;termism. Policymakers, business owners, and managers interested in promoting long{\&}{\#}8208;term governance models should therefore reconsider the role of ownership structure.

Policymakers interested in promoting long{\&}{\#}8208;termism should encourage long{\&}{\#}8208;term ownership, for example by industrial foundations.

The lack of close substitutes in the extreme accrual stocks is likely to create barriers to arbitrage away the accrual mispricing. I find that the profits of the accrual trading strategies are mostly concen- trated in firms with high default probability. The effect of distress risk on accrual anomaly is not subsumed by previously documented cross-sectional characteristics, and also holds in various market states and subsamples. Furthermore, I show that firms with high distress risk not only exhibit lower institutional ownership but also have higher institutional concen- tration. These findings provide a possible justification for why the accrual strategy is more profitable for firms with higher distress risk, and suggest that the distress-based accrual strategy can be explained by the limits-to-arbitrage story},

abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether investor sentiments exert significant influence on corporate dividend policy. Additionally it provides further evidence on the moderating role of certain firm's characteristics on the relation between dividends and investor sentiment. Design/methodology/approach A sample of 635 firms from 12 Eurozone countries for the period of 1986-2003 has been used. A dividend model has been suggested which incorporates a variable at the firm level that proxies for the catering effect, as a measure of investor sentiments. The estimation model of dividends is based on the Generalized Method of Moments (Arellano and Bond, 1991). Findings It can be concluded that psychological factors influence the decision to pay. Furthermore, other relevant findings show an interaction effect between catering and firm's characteristics, particularly high liquid assets, valuable investment opportunities, and higher levels of free cash flow. Research limitations/implications Given the subjectivity inherent in creating a variable that captures the sentiment of investors, the author admits that there are other variables to consider. Also, corporate governance factors could have been introduced as well as other countries with different institutional environments. Originality/value To the best of the author's knowledge, this is a novel approach that incorporates a variable capturing investor's sentiment at the firm level. With the approach suggested it has been shown that investors' sentiments impact dividends payout, highlighting its usefulness for managers who are expected to pay dividends according to investors' expectations. Moreover, this work also demonstrated that firm's characteristics could affect the investor sentiments for dividends also conveying a valuable contribution for investors.},

The results suggest that the information contained in the reports is used and useful for financial analysis, and demonstrate how they use it as an input to their valuation models. The analysts do, however, identify some concerns with the reports. These concerns relate to three areas: the experience of the “qualified person” with specific minerals; the independence of third-parties who provide assurance over the report; and the frequency of the reports. The implications of these results for future policy amendments include changes to the definition of a “qualified person” that should state a minimum number of years' experience with specific minerals reported on, standards to disclose the relationship between third party assurance providers and the companies that engage them, and specific guidance over the materiality of events that trigger an updated report. Consideration of such policy amendments is relevant for accounting standard setters attempting to harmonize standards over the extractive industries, and for regulators that use mining disclosure codes that share similar “competent person”, independence, and technical reporting requirements.},

The earliest results evidenced that VIX is the gauge of investor fear, where in the expected stock market volatility rises when the given market is declined. It is also proven that expected volatility is being unbiased estimate of the actual return volatility (30-calendar days); hence, during the market turmoil VIX likely to be biased. Lastly, it is suggested that the nervousness of investor yields potential profit to the options seller (market crises).

We find that when sentiment is high, analysts' forecasts of one-year-ahead earnings and long-term earnings growth are relatively more optimistic for “uncertain” or “difficult-to-value” firms. Adding these forecast errors to a regression of stock returns on sentiment absorbs a sizable fraction of the explanatory power of sentiment for the cross section of future returns. This finding provides direct support for the notion that investor sentiment affects the earnings expectations of hard-to-value firms. Additional tests suggest that this bias in expectations is unlikely to be strategic in nature. Our results provide new insight into the mechanism through which investor sentiment affects returns.},

@article{Asem2016,
abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to empirically test whether stock liquidity and investor sentiment have interactive effects on seasoned equity offers (SEOs) price discounts in Australia. Design/methodology/approach - The authors focus on the implicit cost borne by firms when issuing seasoned equity capital. This cost is measured as the relative difference between the SEO offer price and the last close price prior to the announcement of the issue. The primary measure of investor sentiment is a composite index constructed similar to that in Baker and Wurgler (2007). Findings - The results show that, in periods of deteriorating investor sentiment, the increase in SEO price discounts for firms with illiquid stocks is larger than the corresponding increase for firms with liquid stocks. This suggests that, as sentiment wanes, investors become even more concerned about illiquidity, leading to even greater required compensation for holding illiquid assets. The authors find that information asymmetry is positively related to SEO price discounts but this relation is not affected by changing investor sentiment. Research limitations/implications - Collectively, the empirical results provide support for the argument that price discount of SEOs represents compensation to investors for bearing costs associated with illiquidity. The results also lend some support to the behavioural argument that pricing of equity offers is dependent upon investor sentiment, particularly for firms with illiquid stocks. Practical implications - The ability for firms to raise capital in a cost-effective manner is critical for firm growth and stability. Investors require compensation for bearing the costs of illiquidity of their investments in equity. Accordingly, firms need to be conscious of their stocks' existing liquidity and its influence on the cost of raising additional capital which, in turn, affects their operational stability and investment opportunities. Social implications - Ultimately, the implications of this study will assist firms in capital-raising decisions, investors in making portfolio investment decisions, and investment banks in setting offer prices on equity issues. Originality/value - To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to examine the interaction between investor sentiment and SEO price discounts in Australia.},

The 1979 paper produced a methodological debate that has not been very productive. This paper attempts to remove some some common misconceptions about methodology that surfaced in the debate. It also suggests ways to improve positive research in accounting choice. The most important of these improvements is tighter links between the theory and the empirical test.

A third improvement is reduction in measurement errors in both the dependent and independent variables in regressions.},

Contrary to this perspective, in this study, we find that the financial analysts, who are sophisticated market participants, may be more vulnerable to sentiment than are other market participants. As a reason for this vulnerability, we focus on analysts??? preference for growth investing, and predict that, due to this preference, their fair value estimations for growth stocks would be more upwardly biased by bullish market-wide sentiment than those of other market participants. We also predict that this optimism for growth stocks would lower the investment value of their recommendations. As is consistent with our predictions, we find that, especially during periods of bullish sentiment, analysts consider growth stocks to be undervalued, even though these stocks are in fact overvalued. In addition, we find that recommended stocks experience poor relative return performance, especially after periods of bullish sentiment, and that this poor performance is not observed after controlling for growth factors.},

The evaluation compares the specification and power of commonly used test statistics across the measures of discretionary accruals generated by the models and provides the following major insights. First, all of the models appear well specified when applied to a random sample of firm-years. Second, the models all generate tests of low power for earnings management of economically plausible magnitudes (e.g., one to five percent of total assets). Third, all models reject the null hypothesis of no earnings management at rates exceeding the specified test-levels when applied to samples of firms with extreme financial performance. This result highlights the importance of controlling for financial performance when investigating earnings management stimuli that are correlated with financial performance. Finally, a modified version of the model developed by Jones (1991) exhibits the most power in detecting earnings management.},

We find that managers' propensity to disclose an adjusted earnings metric (especially one that exceeds the GAAP earnings number) increases with the level of investor sentiment. Furthermore, our analyses suggest that, as investor sentiment increases, managers: (1) exclude higher levels of both recurring and nonrecurring expenses in calculating the pro forma earnings number and (2) emphasize the pro forma figure by placing it more prominently within the earnings press release. Additional analyses indicate that the association between investor sentiment and managers' pro forma disclosure decisions at least partly reflects opportunistic motives. Finally, we find that managers' own sentiment-driven expectations also play a role in their pro forma disclosure decisions.

abstract = {This study extends the literature on the information content of stock message boards. To better understand the effect of online postings on trading activities and reduce the error due to stocks with small message board followings, we examine stocks with no fundamental news and high message posting activity. Such stocks tend to be of small firms with weak financials. For those stocks, we find a two-day pump followed by a two-day dump manipulation pattern among online traders, which suggests that an online stock message board can be used as a herding device to temporarily drive up stock prices. We also find that online traders' credit-weighted sentiment index, but not the number of postings, is positively associated with contemporaneous return and negatively predicts the return next day and two days later. Also, absolute sentiment is negatively related with contemporaneous and next day's intraday volatility and positively related with the proportion of volume in small-sized trades. We conclude that message board sentiment is an important predictor of trading-related activities.

abstract = {How is a takeover bid financed and what is its impact on the expected value creation of the takeover? An analysis of the sources of transaction financing has been largely ignored in the takeover literature. Using a unique dataset, we show that external sources of financing (debt and equity) are frequently employed in takeovers involving cash payments. Acquisitions with the same means of payment but different sources of transaction funding are in fact quite distinct. Acquisitions financed with internally generated funds significantly underperform those financed with debt. The takeover financing decision is influenced by the bidder's pecking order preferences, its growth potential, and its corporate governance environment, all of which are related to the cost of external capital. The choice of equity versus internal cash or debt financing also depends on the bidder's strategic preferences with respect to the means of payment. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {If competitive equilibrium is defined as a situation in which prices are such that all arbitrage profits are eliminated, is it possible that a competitive economy always be in equilibrium? Clearly not, for then those who arbitrage make no (private) return from their (privately) costly activity. Hence the assumptions that all markets, including that for information, are always in equilibrium and always perfectly arbitraged are incon- sistent when arbitrage is costly. We propose here a model in which there is an equilibrium degree of disequilibrium: prices reflect the information of informed individuals (arbitrageurs) but only partially, so that those who expend resources to ob- tain information do receive compensation. How informative the price system is de- pends on the number of individuals who are informed; but the number of individuals who are informed is itself an endogenous variable in the model.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Purpose: Under the assumption that managers have incentives to practice earnings management in optimistic moments, this paper aims to analyze whether analysts' monitoring affects the relation between the discretionary accumulations (accruals) and investor sentiment in the Brazilian capital market. Originality/value: The mediating role of analysts in the relation between investor sentiment and earnings management was not identified in the literature establishing an important gap to be investigated, given the relevance of the reported earnings for the decision-making process of market participants. Design/methodology/approach: Fixed effects regressions (industry and quarter) were estimated from 2010 to 2016, using all data and the subsetting sample according to whether or not companies were monitored by analysts. Findings: The results showed a reduction of earnings management after optimistic moments, which differs from the initial expectation and such behavior is attributed to the presence of analysts following companies. The results were robust to alternative proxies for earnings management and investor sentiment. Analysts have an influence on accounting earnings supporting the best disclosure, so inhibiting the practice of earnings management in optimistic moments. Therefore, although previous studies suggest that earnings management practices increase during optimistic moments, market participants may consider, even in such moments, a better earnings quality when firms are monitored by analysts.},

abstract = {Bali et al. (2011) uncover a new anomaly (the "MAX effect") related to investors' desire for stocks with lottery-like payoffs. Specifically, stocks with high maximum daily returns (high MAX) over the past month perform poorly relative to stocks with low maximum daily returns (low MAX) over the past month. We show that the MAX effect is strongly dependent on investor sentiment and is mainly due to the poor performance of high MAX stocks rather than high returns of low MAX stocks. Investors' desire to gamble in high MAX stocks is not limited to individual investors but is also present amongst some institutions. Controlling for past sentiment reduces the significance of the MAX effect. Our findings provide a behavioral underpinning to recent "optimal beliefs" theories (Brunnermeier et al., 2007) where investor optimism generates a preference for lottery-type securities. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper suggests a new measure of one aspect of the quality of working capital accruals and earnings. One role of accruals is to shift or adjust the recognition of cash flows over time so that the adjusted numbers (earnings) better measure firm performance. However, accruals require assumptions and estimates of future cash flows. We argue that the quality of accruals and earnings is decreasing in the magnitude of estimation error in accruals. We derive an empirical measure of accrual quality as the residuals from firm-specific regressions of changes in working capital on past, present, and future operating cash flows. We document that observable firm characteristics can be used as instruments for accrual quality (e.g., volatility of accruals and volatility of earnings). Finally, we show that our measure of accrual quality is positively related to earnings persistence.},

Since without the offer proceeds 62.6{\%} of issuers would run out of cash (81.1{\%} would have subnormal cash balances) the year after the SEO, a near-term cash need is the primary SEO motive, with market-timing opportunities and lifecycle stage exerting only ancillary influences.},

abstract = {We provide insights into earnings quality from a survey of 169 CFOs of public companies and in-depth interviews of 12 CFOs and two standard setters. CFOs believe that (i) above all, high-quality earnings are sustainable and repeatable; specific characteristics include consistent reporting choices, backing by actual cash flows, and absence of one-time items and long-term estimates; (ii) about 50{\%} of earnings quality is driven by non-discretionary factors such as industry and macro-economic conditions; (iii) in any given period, about 20{\%} of firms manage earnings to misrepresent economic performance, and for such firms 10{\%} of EPS is typically managed; (iv) earnings manipulation is hard to unravel from the outside but peer comparisons and lack of correspondence between earnings and cash flows provide helpful red flags. In addition, CFOs disagree with current standard setting on a number of issues including the sheer number of promulgated rules, the top-down approach to rule-making, the neglect of the matching principle, and the emphasis on fair value accounting. They indicate that a rules-based culture makes the audit function centralized and mechanical, and hinders the development of audit professionals. A summary impression from our work is that CFOs view earnings quality as more of a single and unconditional characteristic, in contrast to current research where measures of earnings quality are strongly conditional on the decision setting. This CFO view is related to their idea of "one number" - a single earnings metric that shapes both their interactions with external stakeholders and internal decision-making. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Assim, a estrutura de capital seria determinada por tentativas passadas de emitir t{\'{i}}tulos em momentos considerados favor{\'{a}}veis para a emiss{\~{a}}o. O presente trabalho teve por objetivo examinar o comportamento de market timing em companhias abertas brasileiras, buscando verificar a exist{\^{e}}ncia e persist{\^{e}}ncia de um comportamento oportunista quando da escolha dentre diferentes fontes de financiamento. Para tanto, foram desenvolvidos dois estudos complementares. Primeiramente, investiga-se o comportamento de market timing por meio da an{\'{a}}lise da influ{\^{e}}ncia de valores de mercado hist{\'{o}}ricos sobre a estrutura de capital de companhias brasileiras que realizaram IPO no per{\'{i}}odo 2001-2011. Como principal resultado, verifica-se uma rela{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o negativa entre valores de mercado hist{\'{o}}ricos e alavancagem, evidenciando que, em momentos de altos valores de mercado, as empresas reduzem o endividamento, por ser mais vantajosa a emiss{\~{a}}o de a{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es, e vice-versa, o que pode indicar um comportamento oportunista na capta{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de recursos. No entanto, o comportamento n{\~{a}}o {\'{e}} permanente em todo o per{\'{i}}odo, a ponto de determinar a estrutura de capital destas empresas. Assim, julgou-se necess{\'{a}}rio examinar diretamente os efeitos do market timing sobre a estrutura de capital de companhias brasileiras relacionando indicadores de custo de capital (pr{\'{o}}prio e de terceiros) com os n{\'{i}}veis de endividamento destas companhias. Para tanto, foram utilizadas duas amostras: a primeira foi composta por 235 companhias abertas ativas na BM{\&}FBOVESPA, analisadas no per{\'{i}}odo 2000-2011; a segunda foi composta por 75 companhias abertas ativas e com ratings de cr{\'{e}}dito atribu{\'{i}}dos pelas principais ag{\^{e}}ncias de classifica{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de risco, analisadas no per{\'{i}}odo 2005-2011. Foram utilizadas quatro proxies para o custo de capital pr{\'{o}}prio, baseadas no Modelo de Precifica{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de Ativos Financeiros - CAPM, e duas proxies para o custo de capital de terceiros, sendo uma delas baseada no custo m{\'{e}}dio do passivo oneroso e a outra no rating de cr{\'{e}}dito das companhias, esta {\'{u}}ltima testada apenas para a amostra 2. Os resultados obtidos com os modelos de dados em painel indicaram que quanto maior o custo de capital pr{\'{o}}prio, maior o n{\'{i}}vel de endividamento, bem como, quanto maior o custo de capital de terceiros, menor a utiliza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de d{\'{i}}vida como fonte de financiamento. Estes resultados est{\~{a}}o de acordo com o esperado pela teoria de market timing, refletindo que as empresas est{\~{a}}o atentas ao custo de diferentes fontes de recursos, em busca das melhores alternativas de financiamento. Este comportamento se justifica e {\'{e}} confirmado por meio dos resultados obtidos: no primeiro estudo, verifica-se que o valor de mercado, em m{\'{e}}dia, caiu ap{\'{o}}s a abertura de capital, tornando indesej{\'{a}}vel a emiss{\~{a}}o de novas a{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es e prefer{\'{i}}vel a utiliza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de d{\'{i}}vida. No segundo estudo, verifica-se que as proxies para custo de capital se mostraram as vari{\'{a}}veis mais significativas, exercendo forte influ{\^{e}}ncia sobre a estrutura de capital das empresas. Assim sendo, os resultados obtidos se complementam e levam {\`{a}} confirma{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o da tese proposta: o market timing influencia a estrutura de capital de companhias abertas brasileiras, sendo que as empresas aproveitam janelas de oportunidades para a capta{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de recursos para financiar seus projetos de investimento.},

The sample consisted of companies listed on BM{\&}FBOVESPA which were grouped into quintiles, each representing a portfolio, according to the magnitude of the following characteristics: market value, total annualized risk and listing time on BM{\&}FBOVESPA. Next, we calculated the average return of each portfolio for every quarter. The data for the first and last quintiles were analyzed via two-factor ANOVA, using sentiment index of the previous period (positive or negative) as the main factor and each characteristic as controlling factors. Finally, the sentiment index was included in a panel data pricing model. The results indicate a significant and negative relationship between the market sentiment index and the future rates of return. These findings suggest the existence of a reversion pattern in stock returns, meaning that after a positive sentiment period, the impact on subsequent stock returns is negative, and vice-versa.},

Although one of the earliest multivariate techniques it continues to be the subject of much research, ranging from new model- based approaches to algorithmic ideas from neural networks.

The second edition updates and substantially expands the original version, and is once again the definitive text on the subject. It includes core material, current research and a wide range of applications. Its length is nearly double that of the first edition. Researchers in statistics, or in other fields that use principal component analysis, will find that the book gives an authoritative yet accessible account of the subject. It is also a valuable resource for graduate courses in multivariate analysis. The book requires some knowledge of matrix algebra.

However, our evidence shows that portfolios with higher risk exposure do not earn higher returns. More importantly, our evidence shows a striking two-regime pattern for all 10 macro-related factors: high-risk portfolios earn significantly higher returns than low-risk portfolios following low-sentiment periods, whereas the exact opposite occurs following high-sentiment periods. These findings are consistent with a setting in which market-wide sentiment is combined with short-sale impediments and sentiment-driven investors undermine the traditional risk-return tradeoff, especially during high-sentiment periods.},

Finance in its modern form really dates only from the 1950s. In the forty years since then, the field A has come to surpass many, perhaps even most, of the more traditional fields of economics in terms of the numbers of students enrolled in finance courses, the numbers of faculty teaching finance courses, and above all in the quantity and quality of their combined schol- arly output. The huge body of scholarly research in finance over the last forty years falls naturally into two main streams. And no, I don't mean “asset pricing” and “cor- porate finance,” but instead a deeper division that cuts across both. The division I have in mind is the more fundamental one between what I will call the business school approach to finance and the economics department approach. Let me say immediately, however, that my distinction is purely “notional,” not physical — a dis- tinction over what the field is really all about, not where the offices of the faculty happen to be located.},

Using a large detailed sample of corporate public debt issues, private placements, Rule 144A issues and bank loans over the period 1970-2006, we investigate the relationship between interest rate changes and issues of floating and fixed-rate debt. Our results indicate that both past and future rates are associated with issuance decisions. We examine whether firms are able to lower their cost of capital by anticipating future rate changes, controlling for firm characteristics and market conditions. Our findings suggest that evidence of timing success is dependent on the time interval and type of debt examined. Over the longest time intervals available in our data, we do not find evidence of timing ability for fixed-rate or floating-rate debt issues. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

So much of the behavior of M/B is driven by firm-specific deviations from short-run industry pricing, that long-run components of M/B run counter to the conventional wisdom: Low long-run value to book firms buy high long-run value-to-book firms. Misvaluation affects who buys whom, as well as method of payment, and combines with neoclassical explanations to explain aggregate merger activity.},

Management is assumed to know more about the firm's value than potential investors. Investors interpret the firm's actions rationally. An equilibrium model of the issue-invest decision is developed under these assumptions. The model shows that firms may refuse to issue stock, and therefore may pass up valuable investment opportunities. The model suggests explanations for several aspects of corporate financing behavior, including the tendency to rely on internal sources of funds, and to prefer debt to equity if external financing is required. Extensions and applications of the model are discussed. ?? 1984.},

@article{Ohlson2015,
abstract = {OLS-based archival accounting research encounters two well-known problems. First, outliers tend to influence results excessively. Second, heteroscedastic error terms raise the spectre of inefficient estimation and the need to scale variables. This paper applies a robust estimation approach due to Theil (1950) and Sen (1968) (TS henceforth). The TS method is easily understood and it circumvents the two problems in an elegant, direct way. Because TS and OLS are roughly equally efficient under OLS-ideal conditions (Wilcox 2010), one naturally hypothesizes that TS should be more efficient than OLS under non-ideal conditions. This research compares the relative efficiency of OLS vs. TS in cross-sectional valuation settings. There are two dependent variables, market value and subsequent year earnings; basic accounting variables appear on the equations' right-hand side. Two criteria are used to compare the estimation methods' performance: (i) the inter-temporal stability of estimated coefficients and (ii) the goodness-of-fit as measured by the fitted values' ability to explain actual values. TS dominates OLS on both criteria, and often materially so. Differences in inter-temporal stability of estimated coefficients are particularly apparent, partially due to OLS estimates occasionally resulting in “incorrect” signs. Conclusions remain even if winsorization and the scaling of variables modify OLS.},

Findings provide evidence that smoothing is associated with firm size, the existence of bonus compensation plans, and the divergence of actual earnings from expectations. In addition, findings indicate that smoothing, by accounting changes is associated with the impact of the accounting change on the level of earnings. This is consistent with management recognizing and making trade-offs between the effect of accounting choices on both income levels and income variability.},

abstract = {In the recent weeks of market turmoil, financial news services have begun routinely reporting the level of the CBOE's Market Volatility Index or “VIX”, for short. While this new practice is healthy in the sense that investors are asking for more information in helping to assess the state of the current economic environment and to guide through turbulent waters, it is important to understand exactly what the index means in order to fully capture its usefulness to the market and to avoid misunderstanding and misconception. The purpose of paper is to describe the VIX and its history and purpose, and to explain how it fits within the array of indexes that help describe where the economy stands relative to other points in recent decades.},

abstract = {We show that the positive relation between institutional ownership and future stock returns documented in Gompers and Metrick (2001) is driven by short- term institutions. Furthermore, short-term institutions' trading forecasts future stock returns. This predictability does not reverse in the long run and is stronger for small and growth stocks. Short-term institutions' trading is also positively related to future earnings surprises. By contrast, long-term institutions' trading does not forecast future returns, nor is it related to future earnings news. Our results are consistent with the view that short-term institutions are better informed and they trade actively to exploit their informational advantage.},

In this paper, the dynamic behavior of market volatility is assessed by forecasting the volatility implied in the transaction prices of Standard {\&} Poor's 100 index options. We test and reject the hypothesis that volatility changes are unpredictable. However, while our statistical model delivers precise forecasts, abnormal returns are not possible in a trading strategy (based on daily out-of-sample volatility projections) which takes transaction costs into account, suggesting that predictable time-varying volatility is consistent with market efficiency.},

Share issuance plays a bigger role than debt issuance in causing these effects. Alternative tests that do not rely on q and cash flow sensitivities suggest that recessions and low sentiment increase external finance costs, thereby limiting investment and employment.},

We analyze historical long-term growth rates across a broad cross section of stocks using several indicators of operating performance. We test for persistence and predictability in growth. While some firms have grown at high rates historically, they are relatively rare instances. There is no persistence in long-term earnings growth beyond chance, and there is low predictability even with a wide variety of predictor variables. Specifically, IBES growth forecasts are overly optimistic and add little predictive power. Valuation ratios also have limited ability to predict future growth.},

abstract = {We examine the association between investor expectations and its components and sell-side analysts' short-run quarterly earnings forecast bias and forecast accuracy. To measure investor expectations, we use the Index of Consumer Expectations survey and decompose it into the 'fundamental' component related to underlying economic factors (FUND) and the 'sentiment' component unrelated to underlying economic factors (SENT). We find that analysts are the most optimistic and the least accurate when SENT is higher. Management long-horizon earnings forecasts attenuate the effects of SENT on forecast optimism and forecast accuracy. Analysts are also the most accurate when FUND is higher. Last, the market places more weight on unexpected earnings when SENT is high. These findings suggest that analysts are affected by investor sentiment and the market reacts more strongly to unexpected earnings when analyst forecasts are the least accurate. The last result potentially explains why prior research (for example, Baker and Wurgler, The Journal of Finance 61:1645-1680, ) finds an association between investor sentiment and cross-sectional stock returns.

abstract = {We examine the impact of mispricing on corporate investments and its components: capital expenditures, research and development, acquisitions, and asset sales. By decomposing the market-to-book ratio into mispricing and growth components, we show that corporate investments are linked to mispricing through market-timing and catering, after controlling for growth and financial slack. This investment-mispricing link is more pronounced in financially constrained firms and in firms with short-horizon shareholders. Overall, our study indicates that the sensitivity of investments to mispricing is a function of the nature of mispricing, the type of investment, and the firm's characteristics.},

@article{Gores2015,
abstract = {We test the impact of investor sentiment on operating expenditure drawing on the catering theory which predicts that self-interested managers adjust their corporate policies to noise traders' misperceptions in periods of high sentiment. Consistent with prior literature suggesting that noise traders prefer high growth stocks, we find that managers increase spending related to R{\&}D, advertisement, SG{\&}A and tend to hire more employees in response to high sentiment. Cross-sectional analyses show that (1) catering increases as managers' horizons decrease, (2) catering is more pronounced for those firms that are more strongly affected by investor sentiment, and (3) catering through SG{\&}A resources increases for firms for which SG{\&}A costs have higher value relevance. Building on this finding, we examine whether earnings targets moderate catering tendencies. Our results suggest that managers cater less in the presence of incentives to meet earnings targets, indicating a trade-off between meeting investors' real activity expectations vs. meeting investors' financial performance expectations.},

abstract = {We build a model that helps to explain why increases in liquidity-such as lower bid-ask spreads, a lower price impact of trade, or higher turnover-predict lower subsequent returns in both firm-level and aggregate data. The model features a class of irrational investors, who underreact to the information contained in order flow, thereby boosting liquidity. In the presence of short-sales constraints, high liquidity is a symptom of the fact that the market is dominated by these irrational investors, and hence is overvalued. This theory can also explain how managers might successfully time the market for seasoned equity offerings, by simply following a rule of thumb that involves issuing when the SEO market is particularly liquid. Empirically, we find that: (i) aggregate measures of equity issuance and share turnover are highly correlated; yet (ii) in a multiple regression, both have incremental predictive power for future equal-weighted market returns. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A generation ago, the efficient market hypothesis was widely accepted by academic financial economists; for example, see Eugene Fama's (1970) influential survey article, "Efficient Capital Markets." It was generally be- lieved that securities markets were extremely efficient in reflecting information about individual stocks and about the stock market as a whole. The accepted view was that when information arises, the news spreads very quickly and is incorporated into the prices of securities without delay. Thus, neither technical analysis, which is the study of past stock prices in an attempt to predict future prices, nor even fundamental analysis, which is the analysis of financial information such as com- pany earnings and asset values to help investors select "undervalued" stocks, would enable an investor to achieve returns greater than those that could be obtained by holding a randomly selected portfolio of individual stocks, at least not with com- parable risk.},

@article{Chen2009,
abstract = {While asset impairment reversals are practiced in many jurisdictions, empirical evidence is rare. China provides us with a unique opportunity to examine both the determinants and consequences of impairment reversals resulting from recent developments in standard-setting and its specific performance-based listing requirements. Based on a sample of reversal firms in China, we report the following findings: First, Chinese-listed com- panies are motivated by regulatory incentives to reverse asset impairments to reduce or avoid the possibility of trading suspension or de-listing. Sec- ond, we provide some evidence that the value-relevance of reversal infor- mation appears to be negatively affected by the regulatory-motivated earnings management. Third, favorable internal and external monitoring mechanisms play a role in constraining this type of earnings management. Taken together, we conclude that while the intention of granting reversal discretion is for managers to reveal private value recovery information, our findings suggest that a seemingly improved accounting standard does not necessarily lead to its intended consequence in financial reporting.},

abstract = {The history of the stock market is full of events striking enough to earn their own names: the Great Crash of 1929, the 'Tronics Boom of the early 1960s, the Go-Go Years of the late 1960s, the Nifty Fifty bubble of the early 1970s, the Black Monday crash of October 1987, and the Internet or Dot.com bubble of the 1990s. Each of these events refers to a dramatic level or change in stock prices that seems to defy explanation. The standard finance model, in which unemotional investors always force capital market prices to equal the rational present value of expected future cash flows, has considerable difficulty fitting these patterns. Re- searchers in behavioral finance have therefore been working to augment the standard model with an alternative model built on two basic assumptions. The first assumption, laid out in Delong, Shleifer, Summers, and Waldmann (1990), is that investors are subject to sentiment. Investor sentiment, defined broadly, is a belief about future cash flows and investment risks that is not justified by the facts at hand. The second assumption, emphasized by Shleifer and Vishny (1997), is that betting against sentimental investors is costly and risky. As a result, rational investors, or arbitrageurs as they are often called, are not as aggressive in forcing prices to fundamentals as the standard model would suggest. In the language of modern behavioral finance, there are limits to arbitrage.},

Our results are based on a proprietary dataset of high-frequency investor sentiment, which is computed based on a comprehensive textual analysis of sources from news wires, internet news sources, and social media. We find substantial evidence that intraday S{\&}P 500 index returns are predictable using lagged half-hour investor sentiment. The predictability is evident based on both in-sample and out-of-sample statistical metrics. We document that this sentiment effect is independent of the intraday momentum effect, which is based on lagged half-hour returns. While the intraday momentum effect only exists in the last half hour, the sentiment effect persists in at least the last two hours of a trading day. From an investment perspective, high-frequency investor sentiment also appears to have significant economic value when evaluated with market timing trading strategies.},

The order submission rules with respect to order type and size are determined by maximizing the expected utility of agents with heterogeneous beliefs on the fundamental price and investment horizon. We show that behavioral sentiment has a double-edge impact on market quality: it improves market liq- uidity by reducing bid-ask spread and market volatility but increasing trading volume; however, it reduces pricing efficiency by increasing the price deviation from the fundamental value. Con- sistent with empirical observations, the model is able to replicate a number of stylized facts and limit book phenomena, including insignificant autocorrelations in returns, but significant and de- caying autocorrelations in the absolute returns, the bid-ask spread and the trading volume, hump shaped order books, a concave relationship between trade imbalance and average mid-price re- turns, and event clustering in order submissions. More important, the behavioral sentiment plays a very important role in explaining the positive autocorrelation in trading volume and also event clustering.},

abstract = {The present paper aimed to study the effect of market timing on capital structure of the listed companies in Tehran Stock Exchange. Descriptive analysis of the market timing behavior of these companies during the period 2008-2012 was insufficient for conformation of market timing theory. Debt rate and equity rate to total assets were considered as the dependent variables, ratio of market value to book value was determined as the independent variable, and profitability, company size, and rate of tangible assets to total assets were the controlling variables. Statistical population included all companies listed in Tehran Stock Exchange, 115 of which were selected as the sample based on the study objectives and systematic elimination method. Combined regression analysis (Panel Data) was used to test the hypothesis and data analysis was done in EVIEWS-6 software. The results obtained from the first hypothesis indicated that there is no significant relationship between market timing theory and capital structure of companies. This means that market timing cannot explain the financial behavior of companies listed in Tehran Stock Exchange. The results of the second hypothesis also showed the tendency of studied companies to raise equity capital through issuing new shares, when their market value is high.},

abstract = {This paper reveals both fundamental and non-fundamental factors play an important role in analysts' target price formation. Analysts' forecasts of short-term earnings and long-term growth are shown to be important explanatory variables for target prices; equally, the following salient non-fundamental factors are also shown to explain target price levels and especially target price biases: the 52-week high price and recent market sentiment. Here, increases in the 52-week high and market sentiment measures of one standard deviation correspond to increases in positive target price bias of 4.8{\%} and 14.7{\%}, respectively. Initially our analysis is constrained to analysts who provide long-term growth forecasts, however, our findings are robust to the removal of this constraint and the broader set of analysts. Our analysis reveals that analysts place greater weight on these non-fundamental factors in settings with greater task complexity and/or resource constraints, and when they rely on valuation heuristics as opposed to more rigorous valuation methodology, and that this greater weight is associated with increased optimistic bias. Finally, our results show that analysts' target prices are useful in predicting future stock returns beyond earnings forecasts and commonly used risk proxies. However, in an internally consistent fashion, the informativeness of target prices for future returns is significantly reduced when greater weight is placed on either the 52-week high or recent market sentiment in the target price formation process.},

The evidence supports these predictions.

Using data from China's A-share market, we construct the sentiment index and examine the sentiment effect from the perspective of the expected earnings growth and the required rate of return. Furthermore, we investigate the joint effect of sentiment and accounting information on stock price and highlight the asymmetric effect of investor sentiment and the moderating effect of information uncertainty. The empirical results show that investor sentiment can change both the expected earnings growth and the required rate of return, thus affecting the stock price. However, the sentiment effect during pessimistic period is evidently different from that when sentiment is relatively high, especially for the required rate of return. In addition, accounting information and investor sentiment can both explain the stock price. However, accounting information is more reliable for stocks with stable earnings, whereas investor sentiment has evident asymmetric effect on stock price and should receive more focus for stocks with high information uncertainties.},

This paper explores the issue by developing and empirically testing a theory that argues that publishing a market anomaly may, in fact, be rational behavior. The theory predicts that researchers with few (many) publications and lesser (stronger) reputations have the highest (lowest) incentive to publish market anomalies. Employing probit models, simple OLS regressions, and principal component analysis, I show that (a) market anomalies are more likely to be published by researchers with fewer previous publications and who have been in the field for a shorter period of time and (b) the profitability of published market anomalies is inversely related to the common factor spanning the number of publications the author has and the number of years that have elapsed since the professor earned his Ph.D. The empirical results suggest that the probability of publishing an anomaly and the profitability of anomalies that are published are inversely related to the reputation of the authors. These results corroborate the theory that publishing an anomaly is rational behavior for an author trying to establish his or her reputation.},

@article{Zhang2016,
abstract = {Recent research has shown that managers in publicly traded companies facing earnings pressure-the pressure to meet or beat securities analysts' earnings forecasts-may make business decisions to improve short-term earnings. Analysts' forward-looking performance forecasts can serve as powerful motivation for managers, but may also encourage them to undertake short-term actions detrimental to future competitiveness and performance. To identify whether managerial reactions to earnings pressure suggest evidence of intertemporal trade-offs, we explored how companies respond to earnings pressure under different conditions of corporate governance that shape the temporal orientations of managers. Using data on competitive decisions made by U.S. airlines under quarterly earnings pressure, we examined the effect of earnings pressure on competitive behavior under different ownership structures (ownership by long-term dedicated investors versus transient investors) and CEO incentives (unvested incentives that are restricted or unexercisable in the short term, versus vested incentives). The results suggest that companies with more long-term-oriented investors and long-term-aligned CEOs with unvested incentives are less likely to soften competitive behavior in response to earnings pressure, relative to companies with transient investors and CEOs with vested, immediately exercisable stock-based incentives. Using a difference-in-differences (DiD) specification for stronger identification, we also found that firms respond to their rivals' earnings pressure shocks by increasing capacity and prices, particularly when those rivals do not have long-term-oriented investors and CEO incentives. The evidence is more aligned with the view that the pursuit of short-term earnings as a result of earnings pressure may be detrimental to long-term competitiveness. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {The main objective of this paper is to investigate whether differences in institutional characteristics result in different capital structure determination among countries. First, we analyze the institutional setting in Greece compared with that of other countries. Second, we provide survey information about the determinants of capital structure in Greece and compare our findings with those of similar surveys in the United States and Europe based on Graham and Harvey [Graham, J., {\&} Harvey, C.

Journal of Banking and Finance, 30, 1409-1442] respectively. Greek firms seem to follow an own-business policy and seem to care more about the disadvantages of debt than try to exploit its advantages. Financial distress considerations, market timing and competitiveness are important factors, whereas agency costs of equity, pecking order and the signalling theory do not seem to apply. Conclusions are relatively similar with those of other countries, though specific differences that can be attributed to the different institutional settings do exist. In general however, we conclude that differences in institutional characteristics do not seem to affect the way of thinking of financial managers when they decide on capital structure issues. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

We examine the interaction of these dimensions with stock returns, our proxy for market timing. Based on our market leverage results, we find evidence that firms do engage in market timing by reducing their leverage ratios when their share prices increase. Furthermore, we find that firms in countries with high uncertainty avoidance and high power distance have lower market leverage ratios and that these cultural dimensions serve to reduce the impact of market timing. These results are consistent for developed markets but mixed for emerging markets. On a book leverage basis, the results are generally consistent but less conclusive. To the extent that culture impacts manager perception of risk and investor reception of newly issued shares, we conclude that cultural dimensions impact the degree to which a firm can modify its capital structure to take advantage of perceived market mispricings. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Although the importance of market liquidity in asset pricing has been well documented, little is known about what causes stock market liquidity to vary over time. This paper examines whether the time-series variation in stock market liquidity is related to investor sentiment. Using the liquidity measure developed by Amihud [2002] and two survey-based investor sentiment indices, I find that the stock market is more liquid when sentiment indices rise, that is, when investors are more bullish. Moreover, the Granger causality tests suggest that investor sentiment Granger-causes market liquidity. Further analyses show that market trading volume also increases when investor sentiment is higher. In addition, the finding that the market is more liquid when investor sentiment is higher still persists even after controlling for the effect of market trading volume. These results are consistent with the theoretical prediction that investor sentiment increases stock market liquidity.},

abstract = {The most noteworthy conclusion to be drawn from this analysis is that the successful operation of a multiple key-currency system would require both exchange guarantees and continuing cooperation between central bankers of a type that would effectively limit their choice as to the form in which they hold their reserves. Yet these are two of the conditions whose undesirability has frequently been held to be an obstacle to implementation of the alterlna- tive proposal to create a world central bank. The multiple key-currency pro- posal represents an attempt to avoid the impracticality supposedly associated with a world central bank, but if both proposals in fact depend on the fulfill- ment of similar conditions, it is difficult to convince oneself that the sacrifice of the additional liquidity that an almost closed system would permit is worth while. Unless, of course, the object of the exercise is to reinforce discipline rather than to expand liquidity.},

@article{Alti2006,
abstract = {This paper examines the capital structure implications of market timing. I isolate tim-ing attempts in a single major financing event, the initial public offering, by identify-ing market timers as firms that go public in hot issue markets. I find that hot-market IPO firms issue substantially more equity, and lower their leverage ratios by more, than cold-market firms do. However, immediately after going public, hot-market firms increase their leverage ratios by issuing more debt and less equity relative to cold-market firms. At the end of the second year following the IPO, the impact of market timing on leverage completely vanishes. EQUITY MARKET TIMING IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY FACTORS that shape corporate fi-nancing decisions. A large body of work documents the tendency of firms to issue equity when the cost of equity capital appears to be temporarily low. The evidence is convincing. Studies on market valuations around equity issues are complemented by other findings such as the long-run underperformance of is-suers and by survey results of managers (see Sec. I for a detailed review of prior evidence on market timing). While the collective evidence makes a strong case for the presence of market timing attempts, quantifying their impact on financing activity is difficult. Most direct tests of market timing are based on the positive relationship between firms' market valuations and their equity issues. However, a host of other factors that affect financing policy are likely to contribute to this relationship. For example, firms with growth opportuni-ties, which typically have high market values relative to book assets, may use relatively more equity financing to maintain financial f lexibility. Answering quantitative questions about market timing requires a market timing measure that is not so closely tied to other determinants of financing policy. A research question that has recently received considerable attention is the long-term impact of market timing on capital structure. The importance of this issue cannot be overstated: if true, high persistence of market timing ef-fects would imply very loose leverage targets, suggesting a minimal role for traditional determinants of capital structure. In their inf luential study, Baker and Wurgler (2002) raise the persistence question and offer a striking answer.},

Overconfident managers overestimate the returns to their investment projects and view external funds as unduly costly. Thus, they overinvest when they have abundant internal funds, but curtail investment when they require external financing. We test the overconfidence hypothesis, using panel data on personal portfolio and corporate investment decisions of Forbes 500 CEOs. We classify CEOs as overconfident if they persistently fail to reduce their personal exposure to company-specific risk. We find that investment of overconfident CEOs is significantly more responsive to cash flow, particularly in equity-dependent firms.},

@article{Baker2009a,
abstract = {Much of empirical corporate finance focuses on sources of the demand for various forms of capital, not the supply. Recently, this has changed. Supply effects of equity and credit markets can arise from a combination of three ingredients: investor tastes, limited intermediation, and corporate opportunism. Investor tastes when combined with imperfectly competitive intermediaries lead prices and interest rates to deviate from fundamental values. Opportunistic firms respond by issuing securities with high prices and investing the proceeds. A link between capital market prices and corporate finance can in principle come from either supply or demand. This framework helps to organize empirical approaches that more precisely identify and quantify supply effects through variation in one of these three ingredients. Taken as a whole, the evidence shows that shifting equity and credit market conditions play an important role in dictating corporate finance and investment.},

The sample included all non-financial firms listed on the B3 (Brasil, Bolsa, Balc{\~{a}}o) stock exchange from July 1999 to June 2014. We used the Principal Component Analysis multivariate technique to capture the component common to four different proxies for investor sentiment. The study empirically tested the index series and its variation on the return series of Long-Short portfolios of 12 anomaly-based strategies. The study found that the measure of the sentiment index had a partial explanatory power for the anomalies only when included in the CAPM. Yet, when using the index sentiment changes as an explanatory variable, the study found a relationship with future returns, robust to all risk factors. Thus, it is possible to relate investor sentiment index to anomaly-based portfolio returns. When analyzing average returns after optimistic and pessimistic periods, the values we found in our empirical test were not statistically significant enough to infer the possible existence of short-sale constraints.},

Surprisingly, changes in expectations about this year's earnings are not significant in a multiple regression with the other independent variables. Changes in expectations about next year's earnings are highly significant but with an impact that is much smaller than that of changes in expectations about the long-term growth in earnings. Changes in noise are also statistically significant and are negatively related to market-adjusted returns, an indication that the signal to noise ratio, rather than merely the signal, is what drives price adjustments to new information.},

abstract = {We study the interaction between financing and investment decisions in a dynamic model, where the firm has multiple debt issues and equityholders choose the timing of investment. Jointly optimal capital and priority structures can virtually eliminate investment distortions because debt priority serves as a dynamically optimal contract. Examining the relative efficiency of priority rules observed in practice, we develop several predictions about how firms adjust their priority structure in response to changes in leverage, credit conditions, and firm fundamentals. Notably, financially unconstrained firms with few growth oppor- tunities prefer senior debt, while financially constrained firms, with or without growth opportunities, prefer junior debt. Moreover, lower-rated firms are predicted to spread priority across debt classes. Finally, our analysis has a number of important implications for empirical capital structure research, including the relations between market leverage, book leverage, and credit spreads and Tobin's Q, the influence of firm fundamentals on the agency cost of debt, and the conservative debt policy puzzle.},

abstract = {This thesis investigates the role of information uncertainty in determining the s- tock price performance and managers' equity financing decisions. The previous literature documents the experimental evidence of significant impact of informa- tion uncertainty on investors' preference and decision making. The first empirical (chapter 3) examines the interaction effect between information uncertainty and underreaction anomaly in UK stock market. The empirical evidence is consistent with behavioral finance theory that stocks with higher information uncertainty have greater abnormal adjusted returns, especially following bad news. Chapter 4 further tests the role of information uncertainty in cross-sectional stock returns within 30 global stock markets. The evidence confirms my conjecture that both growth options and information asymmetry are attributes to the information un- certainty. The empirical findings show that stocks with higher information uncer- tainty have lower future stock returns after controlling for information asymmetry and other characteristics of market and firm. Chapter 5 reports a positive corre- lation between information uncertainty and probability of equity issuance among industry firms in US market. The evidence shows that information uncertain- ty does not only affect the stock price performance, but also have influence in managers' equity financing decisions. Overall, our empirical work contributes to the literature with conclusive evidence that information uncertainty amplifies the extent of stock mispricing, which is consistent with behavioral finance and is in contrast to predictions of neoclassic finance theory.},

Our goal is to explain the survival of organizations characterized by separation of "ownership" and "control"-a problem that has bothered students of corporations from Adam Smith to Berle and Means and Jensen and Meckling.2 In more precise language, we are con- cerned with the survival of organizations in which important decision agents do not bear a substantial share of the wealth effects of their de- cisions. We argue that the separation of decision and risk-bearing functions observed in large corporations is common to other organizations such as large professional partnerships, financial mutuals, and nonprofits. We contend that separation of decision and risk-bearing functions survives in these organizations in part because of the benefits of specialization of management and risk bearing but also because of an effective common approach to controlling the agency problems caused by separation of decision and risk-bearing functions. In particular, our hypothesis is that the contract structures of all of these organizations separate the ratification and monitoring of decisions from initiation and implementa- tion of the decisions.},

@article{Huang2016,
abstract = {Purpose - This paper expands the investor sentiment's effect on investment efficiency to the layer of “credit financing”, studying whether investor sentiment can affect credit financing level and the inner mechanism of the effect. Design/methodology/approach - The authors obtain firm-level data from the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets and using panel estimation techniques examine whether investor sentiment can affect credit financing level and the inner mechanism of the effect. Findings - This paper finds that credit financing plays the role of partial media in the process of investor sentiment affecting investment efficiency. Based on the funds increasing effect, with the high investor sentiment and increasing credit financing, corporate alleviate the financing constraints, but also provide a convenient for the abuse of corporate funds. So, investor sentiment positively associates with enterprises'overinvestment, while investor sentiment negatively associates with enterprises' underinvestment. Relying on the particular system background and property right environment in China, this paper finds that investor sentiment has an effect on the over-investment of state-owned enterprises and the underinvestment of private enterprises through credit financing channel, while it does not function in the over-investment of private enterprises. The reason of the difference is that under the soft budget constraint in our country, the credit preference of state-owned enterprises and the creditor's rights management of banks are partially absent. Research limitations/implications - By fusing the special financial environment and institutional background, this thesis further includes in the analysis frame the difference in governance effect by credit financing between state owned and privately owned listed companies, and further analyzes the difference in impact on investment efficiency in enterprises of different natures after investor sentiment has affected enterprise credit financing. Practical implications - This paper has verified the constraint assumption and deepened the research work on bank credit supply and answered practical questions such as whether the banks in our country exercise supervision function over the listed companies and on which kind of listed companies the supervision function plays a more effective role. Social implications - As an unofficial substitution mechanism, bank-enterprise relationship can elevate the investment efficiency by private owned enterprises. Based on the timely research results on credit financing, reference is provided for private listed companies to utilize investor sentiment to improve its investment efficiency. Originality/Value - This paper has proved the specific path which creates the dual effects on resources allocation by investor sentiment, that is, the intermediary transmission in credit financing, clarifying the mechanism of action by which investor sentiment affects the efficiency of enterprise investment and making incremental contribution to the research of how investor sentiment affects the efficiency of enterprise investment.},

abstract = {This paper presents a continuous time model of a firm that can dynamically adjust both its capital structure and its investment choices. In the model we endogenize the investment choice as well as firm value, which are both determined by an exogenous price process that describes the firm's productmarket. Within the context of this model we explore cross-sectional as well as time-series variation in debt ratios. We pay particular attention to interactions between financial distress costs and debtholder/equityholder agency problems and examine how the ability to dynamically adjust the debt ratio affects the deviation of actual debt ratios from their targets. Regressions estimated on simulated data generated by our model are roughly consistent with actual regressions estimated in the empirical literature.},

Consistent with earlier work, we find that these variables have a substantial influence on changes in capital structure. Specifically, stock price changes and financial deficits (i.e., the amount of external capital raised) have strong influences on capital structure changes, but in contrast to previous conclusions, we find that over long horizons their effects are partially reversed. These results indicate that although firms' histories strongly influence their capital structures, over time their capital structures tend to move towards target debt ratios that are consistent with the tradeoff theories of capital structure. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

These models are then fitted to a historical time series of data from 1841 to 2007 and used to predict future population totals to 2033. These results are compared to the most recent projections produced by the Office for National Statistics. Sensitivity analyses are then performed to test the effect of changes in the prior uncertainty for a single parameter. Finally, in-sample forecasts are compared with actual population and previous official projections. The article ends with some conclusions and recommendations for future work.},

A portfolio based on target price implied expected returns delivers significant abnormal returns.More importantly, we find that the abnormal returns are associated with both earnings and price-to-earnings forecasts, which suggests that the informativeness of target price forecasts comes not only from analysts' ability to forecast short-term earnings but also from their ability to assess risk and long-term growth prospect implied in price-to-earnings forecasts.},

We find similar results for the earnings change distribution. In contrast, we find few positive associations between discretionary accruals and beating pseudo targets derived from analysts‐based unexpected earnings. We develop an additional analysis that accounts for the systematic association between discretionary accruals and earnings and earnings changes. Results suggest that the positive association between discretionary accruals and earnings intensifies around the actual profit benchmark (i.e., where earnings management incentives may be more pronounced). We find similar effects around the actual earnings increase benchmark. However, analogous patterns exist for cash flows around the profit and earnings increase benchmarks. In sum, we are unable to eliminate other plausible explanations for the associations between discretionary accruals and beating the profit and earnings increase benchmarks.},

abstract = {This paper contributes to a growing body of literature studying investor sentiment. Separate sentiment measures for UK investors and UK institutional investors are constructed fromcommonlycited sentiment indicators using the first principle component method. We then examine if the sentiment measures can help predict UK equity returns, distinguishing between ‘‘turbulent'' and ‘‘tranquil'' periods in the financial markets. We find that sentiment tends to be a more important determinant of returns in the run-up to a crisis than at other times. We also examine if US investor sentiment can help predict UK equity returns, and find that US investor sentiment is highly significant in explaining the UK equity returns.},

abstract = {We propose a total return-based framework to measure downside risk associated with phenom- enon of capital outflows from riskier to safer financial markets. The proposed method consists of three elements: (i) the general definition of the flight-to-quality (FtQ) phenomenon, (ii) the typological classification of the flight-to-quality occurrences for associating them with the phases of the business cycle and (iii) the automated technique to diagnose the time frames and to measure the impact of flight-to-quality on financial instruments. The proposed framework is applied to analyse the global-scale capital inflows/outflows from emerging markets public debt to the US Treasuries and vice versa. The results show that different phases of business cycles and GDP growth rates, including turning points, could be associated with flights-to-quality of differ- ent types and causality origins. Addressing downside risk crystallizations in flight-to-quality occurrences, new perspectives of integrated interest rate risk and credit risk management are discussed. For strengthening financial stability, we suggest the use of flight-to-quality windows as scenarios for stress testing, both for banks and financial institutions.},

The determinants of capital structure choice. Journal of Finance, 43, 1-19] obtain weak results and hence call for further investigation. We apply a Multiple Indicators and Multiple Causes (MIMIC) model, with refined indicators, to a pooled sample for the period 1988-2003 and find more convincing results than those obtained by Titman and Wessels. With the capital structure measured simultaneously by the ratios of long-term debt, short-term debt, and convertible debt to the market value of equity, our results show that growth is the most important determinant of capital structure choice, followed in order by profitability, collateral value, volatility, non-debt tax shields, and uniqueness. Moreover, we find that long-term debt is the most important proxy of capital structure, followed by short-term debt, and then convertible debt. ?? 2008 The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.},

@article{Stoll1990,
abstract = {The procedure for opening stocks on the NYSE appears to affect price volatility. An analytical framework for assessing the magnitude of the structurally induced volatility is presented. The ratio of variance of open-to-open returns to close- to-close returns is shown to be consistently greater than one for NYSE common stocks during the period 1982 through 1986. Tbe greater volatility at the open is not attributable to the way in which public information is released since both the open- to-open return and the close-to-close return span the same period of time. Instead, the greater vol- atility appears to be attributable to private infor- mation revealed in trading and to temporaryprice deviations induced by specialist and other traders. The implied cost of immediacy at the open is sig- nificantly higher than at the close. Other empirical evidence in this article documents the volume of trading at the open, the time delays between the exchange opening and the first transaction in a stock, the difference in daytime volatility versus overnight volatility, and the extent to which vola- tility is related to trading volume.},

Second, the time series variation in the investment cash flow sensitivity is affected more by changes in mon- etary policy than by shifts in collateral values. Third, asset price shocks primarily affect firms that rely more on bank fi- nancing and not necessar- ily those that use equity financing.},

Managers cater to investors by paying dividends when investors put a stock price premium on payers, and by not paying when investors prefer nonpay- ers. To test this prediction, we construct four stock price-based measures of investor demand for dividend payers. By each measure, nonpayers tend to initiate dividends when demand is high. By some measures, payers tend to omit dividends when demand is low. Further analysis confirms that these results are better explained by catering than other theories of dividends.},

Our study goes beyond the conventional sentiment and stock market returns literature, uncovering a significant relation between sentiment and firm-specific abnormal returns to acquiring companies.},

This book is designed for practitioners of PCA. It is, primarily, a "how-to-do-it" and secondarily a "why-it-works" book. The theoretical aspects of this technique have been adequately dealt with elsewhere and it will suffice to refer to these works where relevant. Similarly, this book will not become overinvolved in computational techniques. These techniques have also been dealt with adequately elsewhere. The user is focusing, primarily, on data reduction and interpretation. Lest one considers the computational aspects of PCA to be a "black box," enough detail will be included in one of the appendices to leave the user with the feeling of being in control of his or her own destiny},

abstract = {A five-factor model directed at capturing the size, value, profitability, and investment patterns in average stock returns performs better than the three-factor model of Fama and French (FF, 1993). The five-factor model's main problem is its failure to capture the low average returns on small stocks whose returns behave like those of firms that invest a lot despite low profitability. The model's performance is not sensitive to the way its factors are defined. With the addition of profitability and investment factors, the value factor of the FF three-factor model becomes redundant for describing average returns in the sample we examine.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to determine the relationship between market sentiment and rates of return on the main Portuguese benchmark and verify whether this relationship is influenced by different economic cycles. Given the subjectivity inherent to the use of variables capturing investor sentiment, the Consumer Confidence Index (CCI) was used as a benchmark. To achieve the proposed objective, an analysis of time series stationarity, Pearson correlation, and Granger causality using the autoregressive vectors model was carried out, followed by the Least Squares Method with macroeconomic variables. The results obtained suggest a one-way relationship between stock market returns and the sentiment variable. In fact, in times of recession, investor pessimism induces linear behavior and the sentiment-return relationship is more evident. This article will thus be of interest both to the academic community, in providing a basis for future investigations, and to managers and investors, with regards to the perception that the predictability of returns will be easier in periods of recession.},

Its central theme is that, unless traders have different priors or are able to obtain insurance in the market, speculation relies on inconsistent plans, and thus is ruled out by rational expectations. Its main contribution lies in the integration of the rational expectations equilibrium concept into a model of dynamic asset trading and in the study of the speculation created by potential capital gains. Price bubbles and their martingale properties are examined. It is argued that price bubbles rely on the myopia of traders and that they disappear if traders adopt a truly dynamic maximizing behavior.},

We conduct the VIX-returns analysis for the 1993-2007 period. Our results suggest a strong negative contemporaneous relation between daily changes (innovations) in VIX and U.S. stock market returns. This relation is stronger when VIX is higher and more volatile. A significant negative contemporaneous relation between VIX and equity returns also exists for China and Brazil during 1993-2007 and for India during 1993-1997. Similar to the U.S. market, the immediate negative relation between the Brazilian stock returns and VIX changes is much stronger when VIX is both high and more volatile. Our results also indicate a strong asymmetric relation between innovations in VIX and daily stock market returns in U.S., Brazil, and China, suggesting that VIX is more of a gauge of investor fear than investor positive sentiment. However, the asymmetric relationship between stock market returns and VIX is much weaker when VIX is large and more volatile. These results have potential implications for portfolio diversification and for stock market and option trading timing in the equity markets of Brazil, India, and China. Overall, our results indicate that VIX is not only an investor fear gauge for the U.S. stock market but also for the equity markets of China, Brazil, and India. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {This paper represents one of the first studies to document an empirical relation between market sentiment and capital structure in the USA. In a sample of US firms we find that market sentiment as proxied by the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index is pervasive and significant in explaining firm financing decisions, both in the long and short terms. When market sentiment is higher firms in the following year have higher levels of debt. This result is robust to different regression models, different model specifications, as well as different calculations of sentiment and sample selection. The results confirm that the general level of optimism/pessimism in society affects financial decisions and leads to market wide phenomenon. This provides some support to the existing literature that overconfident managers use relatively more debt in a firm's capital structure. Market-to-book is found to be a significant determinant of capital structure as documented by previous studies. Evidence of persistence of long-past market-to-book ratios was shown to be not very robust.},

abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the market timing behavior of listed Brazilian companies to verify the effects of the cost of capital on their financing decisions, and hence on their capital structure. Design/methodology/approach – The relation between the cost of capital (debt and equity capital) and the leverage of firms in the period from 2000 to 2011 is analyzed by means of regression models with panel data. For this purpose, different proxies are used for the cost of equity and debt capital. Findings – The results provide strong evidence that Brazilian firms take advantage of windows of opportunity to obtain financing, and that when the cost of equity capital is high, firms appear to follow a pecking order, giving preference to debt financing. However, the decision is based on the cost of alternative sources of funding rather than just on the hierarchy established by the pecking order theory, due to the information asymmetry between market agents. Originality/value – Few studies of the Brazilian capital market have analyzed firms' capital structure under the market timing approach, and none have addressed the same aspects analyzed here. Therefore, this paper will be useful to different users of accounting information by indicating the factors that influence the capital structure of Brazilian firms, allowing a better analysis of whether these firms act to maximize the generation of shareholder wealth.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Corporate investment inherently relies on time horizon, as profits result from acquiring assets or developing capabilities that yield future benefits that exceed upfront costs. Despite the impor- tance of time horizon to understanding resource allocation, knowledge about the subject has accumulated slowly. Our review therefore encompasses insights from several research streams that partially address the subject even though time horizon is not the central construct in any of them. We aim to clarify key constructs related to time horizon, organize prior research about the antecedents of time horizon, explain the implications of several theoretical traditions for time horizon, and detail the range of measures that have been used to capture time horizon empiri- cally. By focusing narrowly on this topic but searching broadly for references, we provide inte- grative summaries of existing research and identify opportunities for new and unique research.},

Investigou-se essa rela{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o em virtude da aus{\^{e}}ncia de uma teoria bem desenvolvida a respeito da natureza complexa e multidimensional da governan{\c{c}}a corporativa. A acur{\'{a}}cia das previs{\~{o}}es dos ana- listas foi mensurada a partir de metodologias propostas na literatura nacional e internacional. Como proxy para ado{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de pr{\'{a}}ticas diferenciadas de governan{\c{c}}a corporativa, foram utilizados os n{\'{i}}veis diferenciados de governan{\c{c}}a corporativa da BM{\&}FBovespa (N{\'{i}}vel 1, N{\'{i}}vel 2 e Novo Mercado). A amostra de trabalho da pesquisa foi composta por 105 empresas de capital aberto com a{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es negociadas na Bolsa de Valores de S{\~{a}}o Paulo e que possu{\'{i}}am cobertura regular dos analis- tas de mercado, durante o per{\'{i}}odo de 2000 a 2008.

De acordo com os resultados encontrados, h{\'{a}} evid{\^{e}}ncias de que a governan{\c{c}}a corporativa influencia positivamente a acur{\'{a}}cia das previs{\~{o}}es dos analistas de investimento. Desse modo, pode-se considerar que a ado{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de pr{\'{a}}ticas dife- renciadas de governan{\c{c}}a corporativa representa um sinal positivo, emitido pelas empresas ao mercado de capitais, capaz de influenciar a acur{\'{a}}cia das previs{\~{o}}es do consenso dos analistas de investimento do mercado nacional, e que esse sinal representa par{\^{a}}metros na mudan{\c{c}}a da probabilidade condicional que definem as cren{\c{c}}as, tanto dos analistas na elabora{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de suas previs{\~{o}}es e recomenda{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es quanto dos investidores na escolha de suas aplica{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es.

Earnings overstatement is greater in the early years than in the later years of CEOs' service, and this relation is less pronounced for firms with greater external and internal monitoring. These results suggest that new CEOs try to favorably influence the market's perception of their ability in their early years of service, when the market is more uncertain. Also, consistent with the horizon problem, earnings overstatement is greater in the CEOs' final year, but this result obtains only after controlling for earnings overstatement in their early years of service.},

Our evidence suggests that these two kinds of sentiment measures do not correlate well with one another. For a short 2 ?4 year period in which we have direct investor sentiment survey data from UBS/Gallup, only the consumer confidence correlates well with investor sentiment. Further, only the consumer confidence based measure can robustly explain the small-firm return spread and the return spread between stocks held disproportionately by retail investors and those held by institutional investors. Surprisingly, there is even a hint that the consumer confidence measure can explain closed-end fund IPO activity, while the CEFD cannot. In sum, our evidence supports the view that sentiment plays a role in financial markets, but that the CEFD may be the wrong measure of sentiment.},

abstract = {We develop a new index of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) based on newspaper coverage frequency. Several types of evidence – including human readings of 12,000 newspaper articles – indicate that our index proxies for movements in policy-related economic uncertainty. Our US index spikes near tight presidential elections, Gulf Wars I and II, the 9/11 attacks, the failure of Lehman Brothers, the 2011 debt-ceiling dispute and other major battles over fiscal policy. Using firm-level data, we find that policy uncertainty raises stock price volatility and reduces investment and employment in policy-sensitive sectors like defense, healthcare, and infrastructure construction. At the macro level, policy uncertainty innovations foreshadow declines in investment, output, and employment in the United States and, in a panel VAR setting, for 12 major economies. Extending our US index back to 1900, EPU rose dramatically in the 1930s (from late 1931) and has drifted upwards since the 1960s.},

The power of the sentiment index to predict cross-sectional stock returns is mainly driven by its information content related to these business cycle variables. About 63{\%} percent of the total variation in the investor sentiment index can be explained by well-known, contemporaneous risk/business cycle variables. We decompose the widely used investor sentiment index into two components: one related to standard risk/business cycle variables and the other unrelated to those variables. We show that the power of the sentiment index to predict cross-sectional stock returns is mainly driven by the risk/business cycle component, while the residual component has little significance in predicting cross-sectional stock returns.},

abstract = {This paper examines systematic differences in earnings management across 31 countries. We propose an explanation for these differences based on the notion that insiders, in an attempt to protect their private control benefits, use earnings management to conceal firm performance from outsiders. Thus, earnings management is expected to decrease in investor protection because strong protection limits insiders' ability to acquire private control benefits, which reduces their incentives to mask firm performance. Our findings are consistent with this prediction and suggest an endogenous link between corporate governance and the quality of reported earnings. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper relates quality and uncertainty. The existence of goods of many grades poses interesting and important problems for the theory of markets. On the one hand, the interaction of quality differences and uncertainty may explain important institutions of the labor market. On the other hand, this paper presents a strug- gling attempt to give structure to the statement: "Business in under- developed countries is difficult"; in particular, a structure is given for determining the economic costs of dishonesty. Additional appli- cations of the theory include comments on the structure of money markets, on the notion of "insurability," on the liquidity of dur- ables, and on brand-name goods. There are many markets in which buyers use some market statistic to judge the quality of prospective purchases. In this case there is incentive for sellers to market poor quality merchandise, since the returns for good quality accrue mainly to the entire group whose statistic is affected rather than to the individual seller. As a result there tends to be a reduction in the average quality of goods and also in the size of the market. It should also be perceived that in these markets social and private returns differ, and therefore, in some cases, governmental intervention may increase the welfare of all parties. Or private institutions may arise to take advantage of the potential increases in welfare which can accrue to all parties. By nature, however, these institutions are nonatomistic, and there- fore concentrations of power - with ill consequences of their own - can develop. [...]},

Using a sample of large Russian companies in nonfinancial sectors between 2008 and 2015, this paper analyzes both equity and debt market timing to explore the impact of market timing on firms' capital structure. To test the robustness of the results, we use several proxies for both timing types and include Russian-specific control variables of corporate governance and ownership. The results show that Russian companies time the debt market to attract extra capital if the value of the interest rate in the current period is lower than the rates in previous periods. The net debt issued decreases when interest rates are high, which indicates debt market timing. Consistent with previous studies, we find that Russian companies do not time the equity market. Added corporate governance factors suggest that younger boards of directors prefer debt financing to equity issuance, as well as more experienced ones. State ownership is negatively connected with leverage.},

In contrast, firms rated a Buy (Sell) are more (less) likely to engage in earnings management that leaves reported earnings equal to or slightly higher than analysts' forecasts. Our empirical results provide direct evidence of purported, but heretofore, weakly documented equity market incentives for firms to manage earnings.

abstract = {Manuscript Type. Empirical. Research Question/Issue. This paper empirically tests the effect of family governance on intertemporal choice. We contribute to the literature on corporate time horizons by formulating an innovative approach to the measurement of long‐term orientation. This approach uses an index that captures investment, employee, and financing behavior. Research Findings/Insights. Our research makes use of a dataset consisting of 701 German firms (6,205 firm‐years) observed over the period from 1995 to 2009. We provide evidence that firms actively managed by founders and/or their families are significantly more long‐term oriented than the control group. Our findings also show that these firms persist in maintaining a long‐term approach in cases in which pressure on short‐term results is high. Theoretical/Academic Implications. This paper supports the hypothesis that trans‐generational considerations can result in family‐managed firms having longer time horizons. As such, our findings reinforce prior claims that agency outcomes can significantly differ in the context of family governance. Furthermore, our results accentuate the validity of the claim to separately account for multiple aspects of family governance in family firm research, in particular management vs. ownership. Practitioner/Policy Implications. Our results will be helpful for investors in selecting investment targets that match their personal time preferences. In particular, it appears difficult to exert pressure on family managers to extract short‐term profits. Policymakers may want to consider removing any barriers to the transferring of family firms between generations. Their orientation towards the long‐term can make family‐run companies sources of stability in their respective economies. This is also due to their less pronounced reaction to pressure.},

abstract = {Our purpose is to provide a review of the development of the modern theory of corporate finance. Through the early 1950s the finance literature consisted in large part of ad hoc theories. Dewing (1919; 1953), the major corporate finance textbook for a generation, contains much institutional detail but little systematic analysis. It starts with the birth of a corporation and follows it through various policy decisions to its death (bankruptcy). Corporate financial theory prior to the 1950s was riddled with logical inconsistencies and was almost totally prescriptive, that is, normatively oriented. The major concerns of the field were optimal investment, financing, and dividend policies, but little consideration was given to the effect on these policies of individual incentives, or to the nature of equilibrium in financial markets.},

@article{Antoniou2016,
abstract = {The security market line accords with the capital asset pricing model by taking on an upward slope in pessimistic sentiment periods, but is downward sloping during optimistic periods. We hypothesize that this finding obtains because periods of optimism attract equity investment by unsophisticated, overconfident, traders in risky opportunities (high beta stocks), whereas such traders stay along the sidelines during pessimistic periods. Thus, high beta stocks become overpriced in optimistic periods, but during pessimistic periods, noise trading is reduced, so that traditional beta pricing prevails. Unconditional on sentiment, these effects offset each other. Although rational explanations cannot completely be ruled out, analyses using earnings expectations, fund flows, the probability of informed trading, and order imbalances do provide evidence that noise traders are more bullish about high beta stocks when sentiment is optimistic, whereas investor behavior appears to accord more closely with rationality during pessimistic periods, supporting our hypothesis.

abstract = {We examine the relation between the fees paid to auditors for audit and non-audit services, and the choice of accrual measures for a large sample of firms. Using our pooled sample, we find that the ratio of non-audit fees to total fees has a positive relation with the absolute value of accruals similar to Frankel, Johnson, and Nelson 2002. However, using latent class mixture models to identify clusters of firms with a homogenous regression structure reveals that this positive association only occurs for about 8.5{\%} of the sample. In contrast to the fee ratio results, we find consistent evidence of a negative relation between the level of fees (both audit and non-audit) paid to auditors and accruals (i.e., higher fees are associated with smaller accruals). The latent class analysis also indicates that this negative relation is strongest for client firms with weak governance. Overall, our results are most consistent with auditor behavior being constrained by the reputation effects associated with allowing clients to engage in unusual accrual choices.},

We find that investment is more sensitive to stock prices for equity-dependent firms than for non-equity-dependent firms in our international sample. Investment is also more sensitive to stock prices for firms located in countries with more developed capital markets (i.e., lower costs of raising capital), higher share turnover (i.e., shorter shareholder horizons), and higher R{\&}D intensity (i.e., more opaque assets). More importantly, the positive relation between equity dependence and the sensitivity of investment to stock prices is more pronounced for firms located in these same countries. These findings are consistent with the equity-financing hypothesis and the catering hypothesis on corporate investment proposed by Baker et al. (2003) and Polk and Sapienza (2009), respectively.},

abstract = {This paper examines the implications of investor expectations for the joint determination of earnings management and asset prices. I propose a dynamic stochastic model of financial reporting, in which a firm manager opportunistically shifts earnings in order to manipulate investor expectations, subject to a constraint on accumulated discretionary accruals. Four alternative investor expectation schemes are studied: rational expectations, constant-gain learning, regime-shifting beliefs, and accounting-information-system beliefs. The main find- ings are threefold. First, there does not exist a stationary rational expectations equilibrium; under the other three expectation schemes, optimal reporting decisions are characterized by threshold rules based on investor beliefs. Second, regression analysis using simulated data indicates that the relationships among earnings, discretionary accruals, and stock returns critically depend on investor expectations. Third, structural estimation uncovers consid- erable heterogeneity in investors' belief-formation processes, with accounting-information- system beliefs providing the best model fit for the majority of S{\&}P 500 firms.},

abstract = {An association between increased index futures mispricing and concurrent index volatility has been reported within several prior studies; in the present study, we argue that expected volatility over an arbitrage horizon also has an adverse effect on the ability and willingness of traders to engage in arbitrage, leading to greater and more persistent futures mispricing. Using the CBOE VIX and its innovation on the concurrent spot volatility as proxies for expected volatility, we present evidence of an increase in S{\&}P 500 index futures mispricing with expected volatility. The impact of the VIX grows exponentially across the distribution of conditional mispricing levels, which suggests that the expectations of heightened future volatility become increasingly detrimental to arbitrage activities when the futures price deviations are enlarged; however, the influence of expected volatility is found to have been reduced during the global financial crisis period, a period during which concurrent volatility overwhelmingly dominated the magnitude of mispricing.},

@article{Peng2015,
abstract = {Purpose – This study aims to investigate whether and how different sentiments affect the stock market's reaction to the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) information. Design/methodology/approach – The portfolio approach, with time-varying risk factor loadings and the asset-pricing models, is borrowed from the finance literature to investigate the ACSI-performance relationship. A direct sentiment index is used to examine how investors' optimistic, neutral and pessimistic sentiments affect the aforementioned relation. Findings – This paper finds that customer satisfaction is a valuable intangible asset that generates positive abnormal returns. On average, investing in the Strong-ACSI Portfolio is superior to investing in the market index. Even when the stock market holds pessimistic beliefs, investors can beat the market by investing in firms that score well on customer satisfaction. The out-performance of our zero-cost, long–short ACSI strategy also confirms the mispricing of ACSI information in pessimistic periods. Research limitations/implications – Findings are limited to firms covered by the ACSI data. Practical implications – Finance research has further documented evidence of the stock market under-reacting to intangible information. For example, firms with higher research and development expenditures, advertising, patent citations and employee satisfaction all earn superior returns. Literature also proves that investors efficiently react to tangible information, whereas they undervalue intangible information. In summary, combining our results and those reported in the literature, customer satisfaction is value-relevant for both investors and firm management, particularly in pessimistic periods. Originality/value – This study is the first to investigate how sentiment affects the positive ACSI-performance relationship, while considering the time-varying property of risk factors. This study is also the first to show that ACSI plays a more important role during pessimistic periods. This study contributes to the growing literature on the marketing–finance interface by providing better understanding of how investor emotional states affect their perceptions and valuations of customer satisfaction. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

@article{Seybert2012,
abstract = {T his paper shows that an important link between investor sentiment and firm overvaluation is optimistic earnings expectations, and that management earnings guidance helps resolve sentiment-driven overvalu- ation. Using previously identified firm characteristics, we find that most of the negative returns to uncertain firms in months following high-sentiment periods fall within the three-day window around the issuance of management earnings guidance. Comparisons of guidance months to nonguidance months show that guidance issuance affects the magnitude and not just the daily distribution of negative returns. There is also some evi- dence of negative returns around earnings announcements for firms that previously issued guidance, suggesting that guidance does not entirely correct optimistic earnings expectations. To provide additional insight into the strength of the guidance effect, we show that the market reacts more strongly to surprises, particularly neg- ative surprises, following high-sentiment periods. Finally, firms with higher transient institutional ownership are less likely to guide, and their guidance is less likely to contain bad news following high-sentiment periods, indicating that managers with a short-term focus are hesitant to correct optimistic market expectations.},

abstract = {This paper develops a novel stock-by-stock measure of investor sentiment which I call sentiment beta. It is defined as a sensitivity of stock returns to sentiment changes. Using this measure I test two hypotheses. First hypothesis postulates that sentiment affects stocks of some firms more than others due to differences in firm characteristics. Second hypothesis predicts that stocks which are more sensitive to shifts in investor sentiment are more likely to be held by individual investors. Consistent with the first hypothesis, I find that more sentiment-sensitive stocks are smaller, younger, with greater short-sales constraints, higher idiosyncratic volatility and lower dividend yields. Accounting for size and volatility, high sentiment beta stocks have more of an analyst following, greater institutional ownership, a higher likelihood of S{\&}P500 membership, higher turnover and lower book-to-market ratios. Stocks that are more exposed to sentiment changes deliver lower future returns inconsistent with the idea that noise trader risk is priced. Evidence in support of second hypothesis is mixed: analysis reveals that institutions stayed away from sentiment-sensitive stocks in the 1980's, but held more of these stocks since the early 1990's. This suggests that institutions may well have been exacerbating sentiment-driven mispricing instead of countering the actions of sentiment traders},

abstract = {Anomalies are empirical results that seem to be inconsistent with maintained theories of asset-pricing behavior. They indicate either market inefficiency (profit opportunities) or inadequacies in the underlying asset-pricing model. The evidence in this paper shows that the size effect, the value effect, the weekend effect, and the dividend yield effect seem to have weakened or disappeared after the papers that highlighted them were published. At about the same time, practitioners began investment vehicles that implemented the strategies implied by some of these academic papers. The small-firm turn-of-the-year effect became weaker in the years after it was first documented in the academic literature, although there is some evidence that it still exists. Interestingly, however, it does not seem to exist in the portfolio returns of practitioners who focus on small-capitalization firms. All of these findings raise the possibility that anomalies are more apparent than real. The notoriety associated with the findings of unusual evidence tempts authors to further investigate puzzling anomalies and later to try to explain them. But even if the anomalies existed in the sample period in which they were first identified, the activities of practitioners who implement strategies to take advantage of anomalous behavior can cause the anomalies to disappear (as research findings cause the market to become more efficient).},

Misvaluation affects equity values, and firms optimally issue and repurchase overvalued and undervalued shares. The funds flowing to and from these activities come from investment, dividends, or net cash. The model fits a broad set of data moments in large heterogeneous samples and across industries. Our parameter estimates imply that misvaluation induces larger changes in financial policies than investment. The investment responses are strongest for small firms but nonetheless modest. Managers' rational responses to misvaluation increase shareholder value by up to 4{\%}.},

In addition, we also evaluate the incremental effect of financial reporting quality on this association and the existence of such an association under market conditions. We find that investor sentiment is positively associated with future stock price crash risk and poorer financial report quality and short-sale constraint will strengthen this association. In consideration of the firm-level fundamental information in stock prices and different market states, we find that lower fundamental information in stock price and bull market state will strengthen the positive association between investor sentiment and future stock price crash risk.

We then comprehensively study their interaction with popular proxies for time-varying market-level sentiment and arbitrage conditions. We find a powerful (relatively weak) role of the variation in proxies for sentiment (arbitrage constraints). In this context, the predictive power of sentiment is mostly restricted to the short leg of strategy returns. Our insights collectively suggest that the dynamics of sentiment combined with the base level (and not primarily the variations) of limits to arbitrage provide at least a partial explanation for inefficiencies.},

Third, the study uses a factor-analytic technique that mitigates the measurement problems encountered when working with proxy variables.},

High trading costs further contribute to the poor returns on option investments.

Examination of the data from January 1963 (when the index was first compiled) to September 1985 indicates that the index is useless as an indicator of forthcoming stock price changes. The number of correct forecasts by the index is equaled by the number of incorrect forecasts. If the Bearish Sentiment Index is useless, why do people continue to use it? The persistence of the belief in the usefulness of the index results from errors in cognition that lead people to see patterns in random data and to neglect evidence that runs counter to their beliefs.},

abstract = {The paper investigates how firms operating in capital market-oriented economies (the U.K. and the U.S.) and bank-oriented economies (France, Germany, and Japan) determine their capital structure. Using panel data and a two-step system-GMM procedure, the paper finds that the leverage ratio is positively affected by the tangibility of assets and the size of the firm, but declines with an increase in firm profitability, growth opportunities, and share price performance in both types of economies. The leverage ratio is also affected by the market conditions in which the firm operates. The degree and effectiveness of these determinants are dependent on the country's legal and financial traditions. The results also confirm that firms have target leverage ratios with French firms being the fastest in adjusting their capital structure toward their target level and Japanese firms the slowest. Overall, the capital structure of a firm is heavily influenced by the economic environment and its institutions, corporate governance practices, tax systems, the borrower-lender relation, exposure to capital markets, and the level of investor protection in the country in which the firm operates.

The historical values of the cost of equity capital have long-lasting effects on firms' capital structures through their influence on firms' historical financing decisions. We also introduce a new econometric technique to deal with biases in estimates of the speed of adjustment toward target leverage.

abstract = {A large body of literature has rejected rational expectations in relation to analyst forecasts. In this paper we start with a boundedly rational premise that analysts and managers adopt are influenced by the availability heuristic (Tversky and Kahneman [1973]). In the presence of business cycles, a rational growth forecast presupposes precise knowledge of the factors that cause a business cycle. In contrast, under the availability heuristic the current state is overweighted in the growth forecast and so whatever part of the business cycle the economy is currently in will be preserved by the investment decision. As a result, under the hypothesis of the availability heuristic we will observe ex-post, a systematic association between the drivers of this behavior (e.g., current state of the economy, industry, current performance) and subsequent forecast errors and (realized) growth when related to specific properties of the business cycle. We test for this condition and find evidence in support of it. The boundedly rational premise also provides a prediction for the nature of information that can improve analyst forecasts. The results from our analysis provide support for conclusion that a major driver of the boundedly rational behavior is ignoring the business cycle. Together these results provide direct evidence in support of Sargent's [2001] conjecture that a plausible reason for departures from rational expectations is the overly strong assumptions regarding the knowledge the agents are assumed to possess regarding the underlying laws of motion for the economy.},

This paper bridges the gap between empirical findings and financial theory. By slightly modifying the Lucas (Lucas, R.E., 1978. Asset prices in an exchange economy. Econometrica 46, 1429-1445.) model, this study shows how investor mood variations affect equilibrium asset prices and expected returns.Analysis results indicate that both equity and bill prices correlate positively with investor mood, with higher asset prices associated with better mood. Conversely, expected asset returns correlate negatively with investor mood. Further, the mood effect on asset prices increases when investors are in a good mood, and mood variations exhibit a greater influence on equity markets than on bill markets. Results of this study suggest that investor mood is a vital factor in equilibrium asset prices and returns, and integrating investor mood into asset-pricing models helps to interpret the growing body of seemingly anomalous evidence regarding investor behavior. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The overconfidence bias in relation to investment decisions is well documented in psychology and behavioural finance literature. Less known is that an overconfidence bias also relates to financing decisions. Managers that are overconfident of their firm's future are likely to prefer debt to equity financing. This may lead to increased probability of bankruptcy and higher costs of capital. Empirically it is difficult to measure overconfidence. In this paper we decompose a publicly available measure of industry sentiment into two components: a component common with investor confidence and a component more aligned with manager industry confidence. We find in a sample of French firms that industry confidence and investor confidence are negatively related to leverage and that the unique component of manager industry confidence is positively related to leverage. This provides some support to the theory that overconfident managers prefer debt to equity. In the sample of French firms, the investor confidence component dominates, resulting in an overall negative effect of industry confidence with leverage. This may be due to higher levels of blockholder control and/or a weaker business environment in France relative to other countries.},

abstract = {A standard proposition in open-economy macroeconomics is that a central-bank-engineered increase in the real interest rate makes domestic government debt more attractive and leads to a real appreciation. If, however, the increase in the real interest rate also increases the probability of default on the debt, the effect may be instead to make domestic government debt less attractive, and to lead to a real depreciation. That outcome is more likely the higher the initial level of debt, the higher the proportion of foreign-currency-denominated debt, and the higher the price of risk. Under that outcome, inflation targeting can clearly have perverse effects: An increase in the real interest in response to higher inflation leads to a real depreciation. The real depreciation leads in turn to a further increase in inflation. In this case, fiscal policy, not monetary policy, is the right instrument to decrease inflation. This paper argues that this is the situation the Brazilian economy found itself in in 2002 and 2003. It presents a model of the interaction between the interest rate, the exchange rate, and the probability of default, in a high-debt high-risk-aversion economy such as Brazil during that period. It then estimates the model, using Brazilian data. It concludes that, in 2002, the level and the composition of public debt in Brazil, and the general level of risk aversion in world financial markets, were indeed such as to imply perverse effects of the interest rate on the exchange rate and on inflation.},

First, although it is not clear whether non-financial liabilities should be considered debt, they should never be considered as equity. Yet, the common financial-debt-to-asset ratio (FD/AT) measure of leverage commits this mistake. Thus, research on increases in FD/AT explains, at least in part, decreases in non-financial liabilities. Future research should avoid FD/AT altogether. The paper also quantifies the components of the balance sheet of large publicly traded corporations and discusses the role of cash inmeasuring leverage ratios. Second, equity-issuing activity should not be viewed as equivalent to capital structure changes. Empirically, the correlation between the two is weak. The capital structure and capital issuing literature are distinct.},

We utilize the database of China Stock Market as the origin of data sources and collect data of the mutual fund flows and corporate investment as the sample from the first quarter of 2007 to the fourth quarter of 2011. Then, we document a significant positive relationship between investor sentiment and corporate investment by using a proxy for investor sentiment. Further, the coefficient of investment-sentiment sensitivity is employed to divide portfolios. Consequently, the empirical evidence shows that investor sentiment sensitivities change differently across the level of firm investment. In terms of corporate investment, small firms show relatively higher sentiment sensitivity than large firms. Besides, the portfolios indicate that there is no significant relationship between other control variables and cross-sectional investor sentiment.},

Although academic models often assume that all investors are rational, this assumption is clearly an expository device not to be taken seriously. What is in contention is whether markets are "rational"; in the sense that prices are set as if all investors are rational. Even if markets are not rational in this sense, abnormal profit opportunities still may not exist. In that case, markets may be said to be "minimally rational"; I maintain that not only are developed financial markets minimally rational, they are, with two qualifications, rational. I contend that, realistically, market rationality needs to be defined so as to allow investors to be uncertain about the characteristics of other investors in the market. I also argue that investor irrationality, to the extent that it affects prices, is particularly likely to be manifest through overconfidence, which in turn, is likely to make the market hyper-rational. To illustrate, the article reexamines some of the most serious historical evidence against market rationality.},

Our study examines the factors that affect intended and unintended termination and the longevity of IJVs. The findings show that approximately 90 percent of all IJV terminations are unintended and 10 percent intended, and that the frequency of intended termination and unintended termination varies noticeably depending on the initial purposes of formation. This suggests that the termination of IJVs is significantly contingent on their formation. The findings also show that the longevity of IJVs varies according to the initial purposes of formation, the initial conditions under which the IJV is formed, and the types of unanticipated contingencies that it encounters. The key theoretical issues and practical implications of the distinction between the intended and unintended termination of IJVs are also discussed.},

Scholars fitting EDV models have generally recognized that variation in the sampling variance of the observations on the dependent variable will induce heteroscedasticity. We show that the most common approach to this problem, weighted least squares, will usually lead to inefficient estimates and underestimated standard errors. In many cases, OLS with White's or Efron heteroscedastic consistent standard errors yields better results. We also suggest two simple alternative FGLS approaches that are more efficient and yield consistent standard error estimates. Finally, we apply the various alternative estimators to a replication of Cohen's (2004) cross-national study of presidential approval.},

We struc- ture our review around questions likely to be of interest to standard setters. In par- ticular, we review the empirical evidence on which specific accruals are used to manage earnings, the magnitude and frequency of any earnings management, and whether earnings management affects resource allocation in the economy. Our review also identifies a number of opportunities for future research on earnings management.},

@article{Fisher2006,
abstract = {By now, the story of the great rise of stock prices in the late 1990s and their great fall in the early 2000s seems clear. In the late 1990s, exuberant investors lifted P/E ratios to levels much higher-and pressed dividend yields to levels much lower-than their historical averages. True to form, stock prices fell in the early 2000s. By now, the lesson seems equally clear: Sell stocks when P/E ratios go above their historical average or when dividend yields go below their historical average. But is this lesson a good one? Statman argues that it is not. In a 2005 study. Fisher and Statman adopted the perspective of market timers, who search for P/E and dividend-based trading rules to guide them in switching from U.S. stocks to bills and back to stocks-such that they accumulate more than the sums accumulated by buy-and-hold stock investors. In this article, Statman follows with a study of market timing in three additional markets: U.K., Germany, and Japan. If P/E and dividend-based trading rules can be used to reliably time the market, such rules should work in similar fashion in all major developed markets. However, we find that they do not.

Confirming the pecking order model but contradicting the tradeoff model, more profitable firms are less levered. Firms with more investments have less market leverage, which is consistent with the tradeoff model and a complex pecking order model. Firms with more investments have lower long-term dividend payouts, but dividends do not vary to accommodate short-term variation in investment. As the pecking order model predicts, short-term variation in investment and earnings is mostly absorbed by debt.},

Traditional macroeconomic variables are of little use for predicting short-horizon returns such as a year.

Predictive regression and stochastic dominance tests show that this result holds both in and out of sample.},

abstract = {This paper investigates how firms react strategically to investor sentiment via their disclosure policies in an attempt to influence the sentiment-induced biases in expectations. Proxying for sentiment using the Michigan Consumer Confidence Index, we show that during low-sentiment periods, managers increase forecasts to “walk up” current estimates of future earnings over long horizons. In contrast, during periods of high sentiment, managers reduce their long-horizon forecasting activity. Further, while there is an association between sentiment and the biases in analysts' estimates of future earnings, management disclosures vary with sentiment even after controlling for analyst pessimism, indicating that managers attempt to communicate with investors at large, and not just analysts. Our study provides evidence that firms' long-horizon disclosure choices reflect managers' desire to maintain optimistic earnings valuations.},

abstract = {This article integrates an earnings-based capital structure model into a simple real options framework to analyze the effects of managerial optimism and overconfidence on the interaction between financing and investment decisions. Several empirical implications follow from solving the model. Notably, my analysis reveals that managerial traits can ameliorate bondholder-shareholder conflicts, such as the debt overhang problem. While debt delays investment inefficiently, mildly biased managers can overcome this problem, even though they tend to issue more debt. Similar properties and results are discussed for other real options, such as the asset stripping or risk-shifting problems. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The mark of a capitalistic society is that resources are owned and allocated by such nongovernmental organizations as firms, households, and markets. Resource owners increase productivity through cooperative specialization and this leads to the demand for economic organizations which facili- tate cooperation. When a lumber mill employs a cabinetmaker, cooperation be- tween specialists is achieved within a firm, and when a cabinetmaker purchases wood from a lumberman, the cooperation takes place across markets (or between firms). Two important problems face a theory of economic organization to explain the conditions that determine whether the gains from specialization and cooperative production can better be obtained within an organization like the firm, or across markets, and to explain the structure of the organization.},

We define an institution's contribution to systemic risk as the difference between CoVaR conditional on the institution being under distress and the CoVaR in the median state of the institution. From our estimates of CoVaR for the universe of publicly traded financial institutions, we quantify the extent to which characteristics such as leverage, size, and maturity mismatch predict systemic risk contribution. We also provide out of sample forecasts of a countercyclical, forward looking measure of systemic risk and show that the 2006Q4 value of this measure would have predicted more than half of realized covariances during the financial crisis.},

The purpose of this article is to show that CAPM has empirical fl aws associated with theoretical simplifi cations and diffi culties implementing valid tests for the model. The article concludes that the limitations of CAPM are challenges to be explained by alternative models.},

@article{Leland1977,
abstract = {NUMEROUS MARKETS ARE characterized by informational differences between buyers and sellers. In financial markets, informational asymmetries are particularly pronounced. Borrowers typically know their collateral, industriousness, and moral rectitude better than do lenders; entrepreneurs possess "inside" information about their own projects for which they seek financing. Lenders would benefit from knowing the true characteristics of borrowers. But moral hazard hampers the direct transfer of information between market partici- pants. Borrowers cannot be expected to be entirely straightforward about their characteristics, nor entrepreneurs about their projects, since there may be substan- tial rewards for exaggerating positive qualities. And verification of true char- acteristics by outside parties may be costly or impossible. Without information transfer, markets may perform poorly. Consider the financ- ing of projects whose quality is highly variable. While entrepreneurs know the quality of their own projects, lenders cannot distinguish among them. Market value, therefore, must reflect average project quality. If the market were to place an average value greater than average cost on projects, the potential supply of low quality projects may be very large, since entrepreneurs could foist these upon an uninformed market (retaining little or no equity) and make a sure profit. But this argues that the average quality is likely to be low, with the consequence that even projects which are known (by the entrepreneur) to merit financing cannot be undertaken because of the high cost of capital resulting from low average project quality. Thus, where substantial information asymmetries exist and where the supply of poor projects is large relative to the supply of good projects, venture capital markets may fail to exist. [...]},

Under each of these circumstances, cash flows are predicted to suffer more severely from timing and matching problems that reduce their ability to reflect firm performance. The results of empirical tests are consistent with these predictions.},

In addition, analysts tend to be excessively pessimistic about value stocks and over optimistic about glamour stocks. We find that both positive earnings surprises and negative earnings surprises significantly affect subsequent returns. However, negative earnings surprises have less impact on value stocks relative to glamour stocks. We also find new evidence that investor sentiments could be an alternative source of superior performances from value stocks. Our results indicate that when the investor sentiment is higher, value stocks earn significant higher returns than glamour stocks.},
